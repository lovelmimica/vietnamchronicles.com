		<Content><![CDATA[Bai Tho mountain is a huge limestone that stands at the beginning of the bay just in the middle of Halong Bay city. If you're somehow like me, a person who loves to experience beautiful places, but doesn't want to be around a hundred tourists in small boat tour, then this article is for you! I was wondering if there is any way to have Halong Bay only for myself. If you add a small budget to that equation, it seems like an impossible thing, but better, believe me, I found a way and it's called Bai Tho mountain!

<em>Keep reading as I will provide you with the guide to experience Halong Bay on a shoestring budget:</em>
<h2><strong>Hanoi to Halong Bay by Bus </strong></h2>
<img class="wp-image-1141 size-full aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.29341646_950182588491306_1156950490_n.jpg" alt="Never ending bus ride to Ha Long Bay" width="540" height="720" />
<div class="image_description">The ride on the normal bus (referring to the bus that is not a sleeper bus) is very tough and uncomfortable. Usually, it's a bit overcrowded and people are sitting on the way between the seats. Another thing is that these buses smell really bad and the drivers will just drop you off in the middle of nowhere where taxi drivers will wait.</div>
There are so many tours and agencies that are specialized in the tours from Hanoi to Halong Bay. In my opinion, taking a tour isn't very expensive and it will cost you <strong>around 200,000 dongs (around $10)</strong>, but if you want to go on the budget, then the bus is the better option. The buses from <strong>My Dinh bus station to Halong Bay</strong> bus station costs a bit lower than 100,000 dongs. It won't be that significantly cheaper and I guess the value isn't near these private shuttles, but at least, you can have food for a day in Halong Bay for that money!

If you're located somewhere outside the Old Quarter in Hanoi, the best way to go around is by taking a local bus that costs 7,000 dongs in one direction. Alternatively, I was using Grab so much which is very convenient and cheap compared to regular taxis (Uber in Vietnam). So, if you choose to visit Halong Bay from Hanoi by bus, then I recommend you to check out their official bus schedule and site <strong><a href="https://vexere.com/en-US">Vexere</a></strong> for details.

It seems there is a bus line every three hours to Halong Bay, so you're quite flexible. The bus ride will take around <strong>4 - 5 hours with one stop</strong> where you could take a snack or beer to refresh yourself.

Also, don't forget to check our complete <a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/public-transportation-in-vietnam"><strong>public transport guide about Vietnam</strong></a>. There are some golden tips that can save you time and money while traveling around the country.

<img class="wp-image-1142 size-full aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.29547340_950182591824639_1956733929_n-1.jpg" alt="Bia Hanoi in the country side" width="540" height="720" />
<div class="image_description">A local beer from Ha Noi is always a good choice to refresh yourself on the bus stops!</div>
<strong><em>Note:</em> </strong>The bus isn't the most comfortable one and it smells pretty bad, but at least you'll get an authentic experience and a few bucks saved! :)

<strong><em>Note 2:</em> </strong>Don't get scammed by a bus driver who will tell you to get outside the bus before the station. They will leave you in the middle of nowhere on the main road and that place will be overcrowded by taxi drivers. That's a nice way to make some money! But again, it's very easy to bargain!

Never ever accept the first price, especially from taxi drivers as they will usually change their mind pretty fast! When I was traveling back to Hanoi, I took another bus which was kind of VIP with one stop on the market. The bus was very nice and comfortable with only a few passengers and the trip lasted around 4 hours. The price was 100,000 dongs and pay attention to the type of the bus (<strong>look for VIP buses</strong>).
<h2><strong>Best Time to Climb Bai Tho Mountain</strong></h2>
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1158 size-large" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC05214.jpg" alt="Halong Bay in March" width="1024" height="681" /> Well, if you're looking for good weather and you don't want to share this beautiful wonder with millions of tourists, the best seasons tend to be <strong>Spring (March and April) and Fall (September, October).</strong> I visited it at the end of the March and it seems like a perfect time as the weather was pretty nice, there weren't many tourists around and prices were just a bit higher than in Hanoi.

You can experience temperatures around <strong>20 - 25C in March</strong> which is completely fine if you ask me. I just wanted to add the fact that a visit to Halong Bay was just a few days after I left cold and snowy Croatia!

We climbed Bai Tho mountain twice, to watch a sunset and sunrise. Sunset was a bit misty and foggy which makes a trail a bit slippery, so be careful! When it comes to sunrise, it's extremely clear without many clouds and you can see thousands of limestones in the bay! When it comes to food, drinks, and accommodation, I was astonished by our hostel price that was only <strong>300,000 dongs (around $13) per night</strong>.

The hostel was located on the main street and we had the luck to be on the fifth floor overlooking an infinite number of limestones! Food was a bit pricier than in Hanoi and the portions weren't so significant. I mainly ate their Banh Mi and Pho. For a can of beer in the town, expect to pay around 30,000 dongs (around $1.3). Anyway, during the stay, I can't say anything was overpriced or I experienced hordes of tourists, but I noticed <strong>slightly higher prices compared to Hanoi</strong> which shouldn't hurt your wallet that much.
<h2><strong>How to Find and Climb Bai Tho Mountain</strong></h2>
<img class="wp-image-1145 size-large aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC05533.jpg" alt="Alternative way to experience Ha Long Bay" width="1024" height="681" />
<div class="image_description">Well, before I did any planning, I was told by so many people to take a boat tour and that would be the best way to experience Halong Bay. At first, I was thinking of getting on a tour, but after some research, I find out that it's usually overcrowded and you don't get the value for the money you pay.</div>
<em>The last thing I wanted was sharing the boat with hundreds of tourists!</em>

Luckily, on my arrival in Hanoi, I met an amazing guy Bryan from the Philippines and we shared a similar opinion when it comes to the way of traveling - we were looking for memorable experiences. We headed to Halong Bay absolutely not having an idea what to do and see. We only knew that we were heading to a breathtaking natural wonder. Before we arrived, Bryan stumbled upon a post on Instagram from one upcoming travel blogger with the alternative view on Halong Bay. We instantly agreed that we're going there! The place is called <strong>Bai Tho Mountain</strong> (the view really gives you much inspiration!).

<em>See on the map below how to find the mountain:</em>

<iframe style="border: 0;" src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m14!1m8!1m3!1d14904.62690776757!2d107.0788694!3d20.9462203!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x0%3A0xe60e88af13062a43!2sPoem+Mountain!5e0!3m2!1sen!2s!4v1553428679934" width="600" height="450" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>

It's amazing that this mountain is located in the residual area, but it's not a very known place as there is no signs or nothing that could tell you where and how to climb it!

<em>Here comes the most interesting part...</em>

You need to navigate the doors of the local house and you basically walk through their house (very warm people) to set your feet on the hiking trail that will lead you to the top. If you thought you would pass through someone's house for free, you'd be very wrong! We're in Vietnam baby!

The funny thing is that when these locals show you the way to their backyard, they will start to wave with <em>50,000 dongs</em> which mean <strong><em>"Give me 50k to climb!".</em></strong>

<em><strong>Note: </strong></em>Later, we found out that there is a house on the left and the owners will let you through for 25k! :)

We went there twice to catch the sunset and sunrise. The sunrise absolutely blew away our minds and the most interesting thing is that only four people in total were there catching the sunrise. It means a whole Halong Bay for us for only $2! :)

<em>Alright, now then you have a location and know the details, I bet it's time for pictures to show you how that hike and view actually looked alike! </em>

If you're looking for more stunning adventures and don't want to share the place with thousands of tourists, we advise you to check the <a href="https://www.asabbatical.com/article/visit-ha-long-bay"><strong>most breathtaking bays in Vietnam</strong></a>.

<div class="image_description">You need to climb to the top of that limestone, but don't worry, the hike isn't that tough. Be careful in the morning or afternoon as it becomes a bit foggy and slippery on the steep steps.</div>

<div class="image_description">At the beginning of the trail, there are many stairs, but later, there are not any. In general, it's not a hard hike, but you should be careful as it can be very slippery to hike there!</div>

<div class="image_description">The stairs at the beginning of the trail are very easy to overcome. After a while, you will get to the point where there are not many stairs and you need to use the help of your hands a bit.</div>

<h2><strong>Where to Stay in Halong Bay</strong></h2>
<img class="wp-image-1143 size-large aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.29634483_950181808491384_1770541657_o.jpg" alt="View of Ha Long Bay from the hostel" width="1024" height="768" />
<div class="image_description">A view from the fifth floor of our hostel. Always ask for the fifth floor as you will have a huge balcony for yourself with the view like this! And not to forget, it only costs $13 for a double room.</div>
There are many options to stay in Halong Bay, especially when tourists start to arrive (<strong>around May</strong>). I went for a budget option again, renting a hostel on the main street in Halong Bay city. The name of the hostel is Halong Bay View Hostel and it acts as a backpacker hub there. The hostel has a small pub with billiards and a restaurant where you could order a coffee, tea or western food.

<strong>B</strong><strong>udget advice: <a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/vietnam-on-a-budget">Traveling around Vietnam on $20 per day!</a></strong>

The coffee is decent, but I make better sandwiches then they serve there, so my genuine advice is not to eat there (sorry guys!). I had luck to have a room on the fifth floor with a huge balcony. The room had everything needed and it was clean. The funniest thing was that in Hanoi I slept on a very hard mattress that feels like you're sleeping on the floor and I was so happy to finally sleep on a REAL bed, but only slept three hours there!

The urge to catch the sunrise on Halong Bay was much stronger than the comfort of the bed this time! <img class="wp-image-1144 size-large aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.29526678_950182308491334_2026605498_o.jpg" alt="Ha Long Backpacker hostel" width="1024" height="768" />
<div class="image_description">A view of the hostel from the street. It has a bar and breakfast included in the price. The breakfast is nothing special, but still, any food is better than no food! :)</div>
I was so amazed by the view I had from the room. Literally, you could see Halong Bay from the balcony drinking a beer! Also, the price was surprisingly low and it <strong>costs only $13 for a night</strong> in two-bedroom with breakfast included. However, as I find out later from a German girl, it wasn't that cheap as she paid around $20 for a night in a nice hotel room with two beds. But anyway, six dollars won't be that hard on your wallet!

		<Content><![CDATA[For true coffee lovers, Vietnam will be just an ideal destination. One of the first things I noticed was the way Vietnamese respect their coffee breaks. Their culture is so strong as well as their coffee and they have so many different coffees to try! Such an amazing country if you love your coffee strong and diverse! One of the easiest, but very tasty and strong coffee to prepare is a Vietnamese drip coffee. When you walk around the city, you can see people sitting on their tiny chairs and sipping their coffee. Almost every home has the equipment for making a tasty drip coffee.

When I tried it the first time, I immediately got hooked and now I'm the part of their coffee culture - drinking a few strong coffees per day, no matter the time. No matter where you're in the world, you should get ingredients and equipment, so you could be always ready for one shot of Vietnamese coffee! Also, it's easy to get your hands on the filter and it's highly portable as dimensions are very small.

It makes a coffee filter and coffee the portable and delicious <strong><a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/souvenirs-from-vietnam">Vietnamese souvenir</a></strong> you should bring home.
<h2><strong>Vietnamese Coffee Culture Is So Strong!</strong></h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1131" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.vietnamese-coffee-culutre.jpg" alt="Vietnamese drip coffee culture" width="1024" height="668" /> You may ask why Vietnamese people have such a strong culture and variety when it comes to coffee. Well, if we look a bit in the history, it's not a strange thing why <a href="https://vietnamchronicles.com/vietnamese-coffee-culture">Vietnamese culture is revolving around the coffee</a>. The country is the second producer of coffee in the world! As the country was a French colony, it was brought to Vietnam <a href="https://vina.com/cafe/">during the 19th century</a> and since then, the government focuses so much effort on producing more and more.

Right now, Vietnam is producing a whopping <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-25811724">2 million tons annually</a> and the number is growing with each year. Vietnamese people usually lead a laid-back lifestyle which means many coffee breaks. It's not a coincidence to see them on the street or coffee shops enjoying their coffee, no matter of the time.

<strong>Expand your knowledge: <a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/culture-shocks-in-vietnam">Learn about Vietnamese culture!</a></strong>

It was a really funny experience when I saw many small chairs set up on the street with Vietnamese people sitting on them while enjoying their coffee. And yeah, it was night time already. They have so many different options when it comes to coffee and it's really hard to choose. I rarely drank bad coffee there. I tried a regular drip coffee (iced and hot), coffee with condensed milk (their regular one), coconut coffee, yogurt coffee and strongest black coffee I've ever had.

<strong>Each one of these blew me away, but still, I really stick to drip coffee for various reasons:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>our host family has the equipment at home, so it's easy and convenient to brew it.</li>
 	<li>the whole process takes around <strong>10 minutes</strong> (they really love to take your time on every action they do).</li>
 	<li>it's tasty, strong and keeps you alert and awake!</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>How to Brew Vietnamese Drip Coffee At Home?</strong></h2>
Maybe it sounds complicated as there is a whole process behind it, but believe me, once you get used to it, it just becomes a nice routine! So, I will share with you the process of making a Vietnamese black coffee with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condensed_milk">condensed milk</a>. You could add ice or leave it black. Anyway, if you're a coffee addict, you will definitely fall in love with this coffee and the whole process of preparation.

<em>Let's start!</em>
<h3>1. Pick the right coffee beans and brand of coffee</h3>
I'm not sure about the coffee around the world, but in Vietnam, I'm using <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Trung-Nguyen-Vietnamese-coffee-can/dp/B000F17AKC/?tag=calisequipzon-20">Trung Nguyen coffee</a>. Many people tell amazing things about this coffee and I think it's not a coincidence that you can find a bag of these beans in every household. If you're not in Vietnam, then my advice is to try to get that coffee brand online.

<em>Don't worry if you can't get it as there are many alternatives:</em>
<ul>
 	<li>use any dark roast coffee</li>
 	<li>medium coarse ground coffee will do just fine</li>
 	<li>any Robusta brand will make the work</li>
</ul>
<h3><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1132" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_6278-e1541324921612.jpg" alt="Trung Nguyen coffee brand in Vietnam" width="768" height="1024" /></h3>
<h3>2. Make sure that you have the equipment (Phins)</h3>
Once you get your hands on the perfect coffee, it's time to find the right equipment that will help you in brewing the ideal coffee. In Vietnam, it's called a <em>Phin</em> and it refers to a small metal cup, filter and lid. You put these three on the top of the cup and simply wait. You can literally see each drip dropping down in your cup while enjoying your time. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1133" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_6050.jpg" alt="Coffee phin and other equipment for Vietnamese coffee" width="1024" height="768" /> It's very easy to get Vietnamese coffee filter and I recommend you to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Vietnamese-Coffee-Filter-Gravity-Insert/dp/B01AK11S7C/?tag=calisequipzon-20">check this one</a>!
<h3><strong>3. Preparation process</strong></h3>
Once you have a coffee, Phin and filter, you're ready to brew your first Vietnamese coffee at home! It will take around 10 minutes, but don't worry, Vietnamese love to do everything slowly. Just enjoy and relax a bit, it's good for your health! <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1134" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_6054.jpg" alt="Phin filled with delicious coffee" width="1024" height="768" /> First, fill the Phin with a desired amount of coffee. I usually put around 4 small spoons, but you can do even more. Vietnamese people usually fill more than half of the Phin!
<p id="PJxWxmg"><img class="size-full wp-image-752 aligncenter" src="http://balkandigitalnomads.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/img_5ac72de50e132.jpg" alt="" /></p>
Put the Phin at the top of the glass/cup. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1135" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_6060.jpg" alt="Put the filter in the phin." width="1024" height="768" /> Once you put a desired amount of coffee inside a Phin, just put the filter on top. <em><strong>You're ready for the showtime now!</strong></em> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1136" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_6062-1.jpg" alt="Process of making Vietnamese traditional coffee" width="1024" height="768" /> Fill the Phin with boiled water, sit back and relax while every drop of tasty coffee is dropping down to your cup. It will take some time, but it's enjoyable, especially when you're surrounded by nice people!
<p id="wiNcCuL"><img class="size-full wp-image-755 aligncenter" src="http://balkandigitalnomads.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/img_5ac72edb26328.jpg" alt="" /></p>
Once all the water is gone, simply press the filter to get the last drips into your cup and you're almost ready!
<h3><strong>4. Iced, hot or coffee with condensed milk?</strong></h3>
Now, it's time to choose the way you'd like to drink your coffee. You can easily add ice or leave it just as it is. I usually put some condensed milk (it's very sweet!) and sometimes ice when it's hot outside. I found out that my favorite is iced coffee with condensed milk! Try out different coffees to find out your favorite! <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1137" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_6069.jpg" alt="Enjoy your milk coffee!" width="1024" height="768" /> Enjoy your coffee!
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>What's your favorite coffee you tried in Vietnam?</em></strong></h3>]]></Content>

		<Content><![CDATA[We, among volunteers, often make a joke that goes like this: <strong><em>"If all your plans fall apart, don't worry, just go and volunteer in Vietnam."</em></strong> :) It's a joke, but in every joke, there is a half of truth.

<em>The last year was the biggest rollercoaster in my life and there are some things that happened during that short period:</em>
<ul>
 	<li>Started to travel and work on the road</li>
 	<li>Did a European road trip with the best people ever</li>
 	<li>Went on <strong><a href="http://elektrijada.net/home/">Elektrijada</a></strong> like a tourist and had a blast in Montenegro</li>
 	<li>Lived and worked on a Koh Lanta, Thailand for a month</li>
 	<li>Dropped out from college and started to chase a freedom</li>
 	<li>Worked on various projects including planning for a huge start-up (It didn't go well, but it was a huge learning lesson. In the period of two months, I learned more than in 5 years of college.)</li>
 	<li>Checking the <strong><a href="https://www.nanakflights.com/cheap-flights-to-india.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cheap flights to India</a></strong>, but instead, deciding to go to volunteer in Vietnam, bought a one-way ticket and here I am</li>
</ul>
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1052 size-large" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_6295.jpg" alt="Starlight - a volunteering project in the countryside of Nghe An province, North Vietnam" width="1024" height="768" /> I've been volunteering in a small <strong>Quynh Luu located in central Vietnam</strong> (about 4 hours from Hanoi with a sleeping bus) for a month already. In that short period, I've learned so much about teaching and actually started to really enjoy in doing it. Also, I believe I'm so fortunate as I'm in a very remote area where you can't see any other foreigner, so I have a chance to really observe and experience authentic Vietnam.

Not to forget that other volunteers, my homestay family, and people here are simply amazing! Even when you feel low, you simply can't react positively to their beautiful smiles that will make you feel happy! Starlight, a volunteering project in Quynh Luu, provided me with so much support, so I just felt to give something back to these amazing people and write an honest piece about my experience there.
<h2>How at the First Place I Went to Vietnam to Volunteer?</h2>
<img class="size-large wp-image-1053 aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_6048.jpg" alt="Lovely kids in the countryside." width="1024" height="768" /> I'm sorry, but really need to share this story as I want to tell you that <strong>YOU CAN DO IT TOO!</strong> Many people reached me and told me <em>"Oh I wish I could travel </em>like<em> you and have the best time of my lifetime.". </em> <em>Well, what if I tell you that you can do it? Would you believe me?</em> I'm just a regular guy who realized the money and chasing career isn't everything in the world. I realized the experience is important as you don't want to end up in a system before discovering the world and yourself.

I developed a strong sense of myself during my travels and started to hate college and situations where someone tells me what to do and think. That isn't freedom at all and I just wanted to think with my own head. At the moment of dropping out of college, I was so confident that I could make it in the world no matter what. So I did exactly that! Dropped out and focus all my energy and time on learning and experiencing new things. After the New Year, I started to feel very lost as I moved to my hometown and didn't feel like growing at all. <img class="size-large wp-image-1054 aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.36331417_883723108494095_3435324016838049792_o.jpg" alt="Outdoor class is a lot of fun!" width="1024" height="683" /> One day I started to check <strong><a href="https://www.asabbatical.com/article/helpstay-reviews">HelpStay volunteering platform</a></strong> and found out an interesting project about teaching English in Vietnam. I checked the details and outreached the head of the organization. The next day I remember checking my email totally forgetting about the outreach and I saw some new email. It was from the head of <strong><a href="http://c4c.vn">Coins4Change</a></strong>.

I was so thrilled! We agreed on a time of the interview, did two interviews and the next thing I know was buying a one-way ticket and flying to Vietnam! I don't think much when it comes to adventure and I'm always up to even craziest things. Here I am, sitting in a very good coffee place, drinking <strong><a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/vietnamese-drip-coffee-guide">Vietnamese traditional black coffee</a></strong> and writing this post.

Life is very good and I'm very grateful for each moment here. In the next section, you can find out all the information about Starlight English Center and how does it look to volunteer here as an English teacher.
<h2><strong>What is Starlight and How Does It Look Like to Teach English There?</strong></h2>
<p id="RByIIzy"><img class="size-full wp-image-828 aligncenter" src="http://balkandigitalnomads.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/img_5ad485850fa06.jpg" alt="" /></p>
Starlight is one of the projects of head organization Coins4Change. It's an English center that focuses on improving the English knowledge of kids that live in a rural place. <em>The rural and city kids (and adults) experience a huge gap in English knowledge, which limits them in many aspects:</em>
<ul>
 	<li>finding the office job</li>
 	<li>lower payment</li>
 	<li>cultural exchange</li>
</ul>
Quynh Luu is located in Nghe An province in north-central Vietnam and Starlight English center is where we're teaching <strong>around 100 kids</strong> the basics (and advanced things depending on their level of knowledge) of English language. The center has two main classrooms equipped with whiteboards, laptops, books, tables, and chairs. It's simple, but actually, everything that's needed for effective teaching.
<h3>How Does a Teaching Class Look Like?</h3>
<img class="size-large wp-image-1055 aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20180326_204832.jpg" alt="One of the classes in Starlight" width="1024" height="768" /> Well, first of all, I want to tell you that I came here <strong>without any prior teaching experience</strong>. So, don't worry if you've never done something similar as it's perfectly normal doing something for the first time and people here are very open and patient and they will teach you everything. Basically, you will teach <strong>a maximum of two classes per day</strong> (one class is 1 and a half hour long) which means you will have a lot of time for yourself. The classes start at 5:30 pm during the weekdays and it becomes a bit busier on the weekends as there is a class at 8:30 am and 3:30 pm.

For each class, you'll have to prepare a lesson with the support of friendly assistants and when you get used to teaching, the<strong> preparation usually takes 30 minutes</strong>. On Tuesday, volunteers have day-off as the center is closed and you're free to explore the place or even travel to other cities/places. It's up to you and even you can travel for longer periods, but be sure to communicate that with other volunteers. <img class="size-large wp-image-1056 aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.dodo3.jpg" alt="The craziest class ever!" width="1024" height="768" /> <em>Starlight has a few groups:</em>
<ul>
 	<li>Little Dodo - kids from 4 - 7 years old</li>
 	<li>Sao La - kids from 8 - 11 years old</li>
 	<li>Amur - 12 - 17 years old and advanced in English</li>
</ul>
Basically, it's up to you to lead the class and teach kids on the way you think it's effective.

<em>My class with Little Dodo looks like:</em>
<ul>
 	<li>In the beginning, we're having fun with each other introducing each other</li>
 	<li>Playing songs and dance around the classroom</li>
 	<li>Review the last topic</li>
 	<li>Introduce new words</li>
 	<li>Play games with the star system (kids here are very competitive and it will make them focused)</li>
 	<li>Play some more songs</li>
 	<li>Working on some tasks that check their knowledge from the lesson we covered</li>
</ul>
<img class="size-large wp-image-1057 aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_6349.jpg" alt="Sometimes, kids become too crazy" width="1024" height="768" /> <em>Crucial tips when teaching kids English:</em>
<ul>
 	<li>Be very patient as kids usually tend to lose focus or interest.</li>
 	<li>Be creative and try to always make them think out of the box.</li>
 	<li>Play, dance and make them having fun, but at the same time educate them.</li>
 	<li>Don't teach them by making them memorize. Try to experience them things as that's the best way to teach.</li>
 	<li>Be energetic and positive all the time.</li>
 	<li>Encourage them and when you see a kid has struggle with self-confidence you should work on it too.</li>
 	<li>I don't see myself only as an English teacher but also trying to teach them basic skills and raise their self-confidence as I believe it's the crucial thing in life.</li>
 	<li>There will be ups and downs, so better prepare for that.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Homestay and How Does a Regular Day Looks Like</strong></h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1058" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_6292.jpg" alt="Courtyard in the homestay" width="1024" height="768" /> While volunteering with Starlight, you'll be accommodated in a homestay near the center living with one of the most hospital and warm Vietnamese family. From the first second I arrived, I couldn't believe how warm these people are. They accepted me as the part of their family instantly which you can't experience in Croatia at that level. I was so amazed and very grateful for that experience and opportunity.

<strong>More opportunities: <a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/teach-english-vietnam">All about teaching in Vietnam!</a></strong>

Thach and his wife Hang are coordinators in Starlight and they manage the center. We're living with them, their two kids (doctor Quang and little Su Su) and grandma (Thach's mother). Also, I don't want to forget to include Dodo, a crazy, but a loving dog that shares the home with us and of course lunch and dinner (sorry Dodo for such small portions as the food is so amazing and there are literally no leftovers). :) <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1059" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_6280.jpg" alt="Lunch with a host family" width="1024" height="768" /> Their home is very convenient as volunteers will have their <strong>own room with privacy</strong>. You have all the important things like a desk, bed, closet, and fan. There is a kitchen where we eat with the family. You will get a lunch (around 11 am), dinner (around 9 pm) and sometimes breakfast. <em>Why did I tell sometimes? </em> Well, if you wake up around 6 am, then you'll be lucky to have breakfast.

Vietnamese aren't so keen on breakfast but really respect their lunch and dinner time. The food is amazingly delicious and fresh. Every day there is something new on the table, but the base is rice in a small bowl and of course a soy sauce.

<em><strong>Thank you Hang for treating us so well with the meals!</strong></em>

In the middle of the homestay, there is a vast courtyard with benches, so that's a usual place for sitting, drinking coffee and speaking with other volunteers. And yeah, you have a coffee and tea in unlimited quantities. ;) There is one toilet and shower as well as outdoors sink and laundry for volunteers. You don't need to worry about it as you can do it at home.

I almost forgot, there are <strong>two motorbikes, bicycle and electric bike for use.</strong> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1066" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.homestay.jpg" alt="Lunchtime with other volunteers" width="1024" height="768" /> I tend to always ask Hang or Thach for the permission of using these as they're also using them. It's just an amazing way of transportation around Quynh Luu, especially on day-offs as you don't need to worry about renting motorbikes.
<h2><strong>Things to Do in Quynh Luu</strong></h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1065" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_6299.jpg" alt="Chilling atmosphere in the town." width="1024" height="768" /> As I already mentioned, the city is located in a rural place in central Vietnam and knowing that there are not so many things to do. Depending on your goals and mindset, it could be a game maker or breaker. I really love it here as I love a bit laid back life without tourists around and Quynh Luu seems like a perfect combination of both.

It's perfect for people who want to focus on building their business because there are no distractions and you will have so much free time. Also, I noticed that I don't waste my time and I started to be very aware of my time so the majority of the time I'm working on the projects, exploring the landscape, going to the gym, driving with the motorbike, eating new food, drinking amazing coffee and having fun with Vietnamese people. Did you know

I've got a motorbike as a gift in Vietnam from a woman I've never talked or seen before? Head over to <a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/motorbike-in-vietnam"><strong>that experience</strong></a>! <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1060" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_6036.jpg" alt="Watching the sunset over the rice fields. " width="1024" height="768" /> <em>The best things to do in Quynh Luu:</em>
<ul>
 	<li>Using your day offs to travel to Ninh Binh, Hanoi or near amazing places</li>
 	<li>Drive your motorbike around the beach and explore the beautiful landscape</li>

<hr />

So far, volunteering in Vietnam is pure enjoyment and an amazing experience. I really started to like teaching and I'm thinking of getting my <strong>TEFL certificate</strong> so I could teach around Asia. Even if you don't have any experience you can come to teach here. People are very patient and helpful, so they will help you with everything. After two weeks you will become very good and natural in teaching (my experience).

Wish to thank my hosting family for making me feel like I'm at home and Starlight for an amazing opportunity. <img class="wp-image-1063 size-large aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_6294.jpg" alt="The loyal friend in the house" width="1024" height="768" />

		<Excerpt>My stunning experience of getting the motorbike as a gift in Vietnam. So many things happened during a two-day visit in Hanoi to find and get this bike back home. Check out this crazy story!
</Excerpt>

		<Categories>Our Journeys</Categories>
		<Content><![CDATA[Vietnam is a vibrant country with such diverse landscape and a deep sense of the culture and traditions. I was aware of that before arriving here, but there is one thing I wasn't aware of - Vietnam is also a country full of pleasant surprises. Before arriving here, I knew that I want to get a motorbike, so I could be able to travel across the country at my own pace and experience an ultimate freedom. The motorbikes here are very cheap, but you know, you get what you paid for. That line can't better describe motorbikes in Vietnam. The most common bike for doing a road trip through this amazing country is, of course, Honda (replica of Honda) Win.

These bikes are usually used by backpacker and adventurers to drive from North to South or another way around. No matter which bike you get, you should be aware of the fact these bikes were probably driven tens of times through the country. It means the breakdowns are inevitable and it's just the question when you'll experience a breakdown (Knock knock, as I haven't experienced any till now!).

Vietnam is one of these Asian countries where the traffic is just crazy! In Europe, the buses and trucks are usually the slowest means of transportation, but not in Vietnam! Here these guys are the fastest on the road. Sometimes it feels like they are playing Need for Speed in a real life with horning on anything that's moving on the road! Anyway, this didn't stop me from getting the bike here.

<em><strong>Note: </strong></em><em>I don't advise inexperienced drivers to learn how to drive a motorbike in Vietnam as the conditions on the road and traffic are very unpredictable. I had the experience to drive a motorbike in Thailand, so I learned how to drive and be comfortable in Asian traffic. </em> Knowing myself, these facts were more than enough for me to decide to get the motorbike in Vietnam.
<h2><strong>Daydreaming About the Motorbike</strong></h2>
In Vietnam, I'm a volunteer, which means I don't earn any money for teaching and I need to figure out how to earn money here. I'm a type of hustler, so getting money was never a problem for me. There is a huge group called <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/882003845187734/">Vietnam Backpackers</a> </strong>where people usually post their bikes for sale. The average price for a decent Honda Win is around <strong>$250</strong> and it was still far away. I was daydreaming almost every day and aimlessly scrolling down the page to see which bike will I, fortunately, get in the near future.

I remember one day was a bit different and kind of special for me! It was Sunday, around lunchtime, and it was hot as hell! (You may think it's just a regular day for Vietnam, but wait!) I've got used to Vietnamese lifestyle, which means I've become a bit lazy, so after the lunchtime, I usually enjoy Siesta time (lying down, <strong><a href="http://balkandigitalnomads.com/vietnamese-drip-coffee-guide/">drinking tasty coffee</a></strong> and practicing the art of doing nothing.).

It was my time of daydreaming, so as I usually did, I opened the group and started to scroll down. There were nothing new, just awesome bikes with the distant price for me, but I was really enjoying the thoughts of being able to get one of these one day. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-1160 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.gift.jpg" alt="Post on the facebook group" width="617" height="501" /> I was re-reading the post a few times as it sounds like a slap in my face. I just sent the message to Julia and we were talking. She is a pretty positive and open-minded woman who is also an English teacher in Vietnam. I said that I would really love this bike as it was my dream, and she said: <em><strong>"It's yours!".</strong></em> I was puzzled! Literally puzzled! <strong>(Still, don't know how to thank you for your kind action!)</strong>
<h3><strong>There was a catch of course...</strong></h3>
It's hard to believe everything is perfect or ideal, so there is always a catch. The catch was that she left Hanoi and she gave the bike to her friend. I immediately sent the message to her friend and we've got in the talk. He was leaving Hanoi the same day and he sent me the message that he would leave the bike in certain location! I've got the pin on the map and the picture where were keys and documentation hidden. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-1162 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.31484454_10104912527233011_3339961470690525184_n.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="960" /> The message I've got: <strong><em>"The keys and documentation are hidden below the bricks."</em></strong> If you've ever been to Hanoi, then you probably know it's a city with the population that is almost three times bigger than the population in the whole of Croatia. The traffic is crazy, the streets are narrow and it's easy to get lost. So, I was on the quest to find these bricks in the middle of Hanoi! I haven't thought a second and just accepted the challenge!
<h2><strong>1000 Battles in Hanoi</strong></h2>
So, I've just hopped to the bus and the ride was supposed to be around 4 hours, but it lasted for almost 6 hours! I haven't prepared myself for anything, so when I arrived in Hanoi, I was greeted by a huge rain! The only piece of clothing I had was tanks and t-shirt. Very smart of me! I arrived at the night time, but I was determined to try to locate the bike, so I went to the location that I've got from Julia's friend.

<em><strong>There was a huge catch!</strong></em> <strong>Expand your knowledge: <a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/culture-shocks-in-vietnam">Learn about Vietnamese culture and differences!</a></strong> I didn't know that the bike is somewhere in alleys of Hanoi. It was a huge part of Hanoi with narrow alleys and local shops around. If you've ever found yourself in that situation, then it's the most certain you will get lost many times until you reach your destination, even if you have a GPS.

The thing was that my destination was to find few bricks of mortar and the bike! Of course, I've got the approximate location and not the certain one! Because why to make things easier as it can be more interesting, especially when you're walking around the chaotic streets of Hanoi. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-1163 size-large" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.poor-baby.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768" /> I met one local man who tried to help me about the location (he was living around the place) and after an hour of searching, he wasn't able to help me! Imagine the struggle and I was so sorry for the guy as he was feeling so bad because he couldn't help me. <strong><em>(I'm sorry that I've </em>forgotten<em> your name man, but if you'll ever read this piece, thank you so much for amazing help and </em>advice<em>!)</em></strong> It was around 9 pm already and I knew it was my last call to eat something as Vietnamese usually close everything after 9 pm.

I went to a Pho place and ate one of the best Phos in Vietnam. Although, I haven't opened my senses fully as I was consumed with the thoughts that I've got scammed or that I will never able to find the bike. Anyway, after a delicious dinner, I said myself it would be the last try! I did a detailed walk around the alleys one more time and in the corner of my eyes, I spotted the bike! I can't describe how happy I was at that moment!

Seconds later I've found the bricks and keys and documentation secretly stashed there! Just wooow! The catch was the motorbike was a bit broken (lights, and the front tire), so I wasn't so eager to drive it through Hanoi without the lights. I took the Grab to the volunteer house to regain my energy and think of the next steps as I needed to get back to Quynh Luu next day!
<h2>Challenges of Getting Bike in Function</h2>
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1164 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.mechanics.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="720" /> I've got some pleasant dreams and got disrupted by a noisy alarm clock that I've set at 6 am. I was lying down on the bed and snoozing for an hour until I've got enough energy to leave my cozy bed. I went to the best Pho place to eat that soup since I was in Hanoi (thanks Bryan for showing me that place!). After that, I headed to the place of crime to check the bike. I couldn't move it as the front tire was stuck and the time was ticking. I went to the nearest coffee place to think about my options and what should I do.

<strong><em>There were a few possible options:</em></strong>
<ul>
 	<li>get the bike somehow to the bus station, put it into the bus and leave Hanoi with the bike. The only catch was that I needed some ride that will get me and the bike to the bus station that was 2 km away</li>
 	<li>go to the mechanic to repair it</li>
 	<li>just leave the bike</li>
</ul>
Luckily, like the universe was on my side, there was a local guy beside me, enjoying the morning coffee. I asked him if he knows any English (such a rude question in Hanoi, but I'm so used to a rural life where no one speaks English). I explained him my situation and surprisingly, he was so eager to help me as his words were: <em><strong>"You're a stranger in my land and I want to help the strangers as when I go to your land I believe in the help from locals there. You get what you get."</strong></em>

We drove to the motorbike and he called a mechanic and they pulled the bike away to their shop.

<strong>Motorbike guide: <a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/buy-motorbike-in-vietnam">Buying a reliable motorbike in Vietnam!</a></strong>

The bike was repaired and while we were waiting, we were smoking and drinking a strong tea in the alleys of Hanoi. This guy was so open-minded and positive and I've made a new friend. The mechanics made the bike functional, but it wasn't fully repaired yet. They said that it will bring me to Quynh Luu with some luck. I did a test ride around and I was sucking so much as Hanoi is crazy with the traffic.
<h2><strong>Getting Outside Hanoi Was a Huge Struggle</strong></h2>
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1165 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.baby-on-hte-road.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="960" /> Alright, so the bike was in a half-functional mode and I decided I will drive the bike back home. I was following the guy and he gave me the instructions on how to get outside the city, but he saw that I was completely lost (scared of the traffic and the weather was sooo hot!) He was so good that, even after spending half of his daytime with me, he showed me how to get on the right road and get outside the city. <strong>(So thankful that I met you, Tuan! We will meet again!)</strong>

The distance between Hanoi and Quynh Luu is about 250 km, so as being optimistic, I calculated I will make it in 4 hours like a bus.
<h3><strong>Oh boy, how wrong I was!</strong></h3>
I started a trip at 12 pm and arrived at my hometown at 9 pm - <em><strong>9 hours of ride on a half-functional bike.</strong></em>

I wasn't aware of the fact that, at that time, the bike was not in a full-function and whenever I went faster than <strong>50 km/h</strong>, it got very unstable and dangerous. <img class="wp-image-1166 size-full aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.ontheway.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="960" />
<div class="image_description">A quick stop on the way to Cau Giat in Nghe An.</div>
So, I was driving for 9 hours on a highway on the hottest day I could imagine. I was driving by day, I was driving by night without proper lights, I was driving while being chased by crazy thunderstorm behind me. I've got me and motorbike home and I am alive!
<h2><strong>Wait, it's not the end of lucky circumstances </strong></h2>
Next day, I've sent the message to Julia with the picture of the motorbike and I asked here where are you now. She sent me the message that they were heading Vinh (the city that is around 60 km away from my hometown). I couldn't believe and shared with her my location, and she said they were passing that town! We set the meeting in my hometown! What a coincidence, right?

<strong>Budgeting skills: <a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/vietnam-on-a-budget">How much money do you need for a whole motorbike trip around the country?</a></strong>

We had an amazing talk and time and I met her and two other crazy guys, Tom and Joel. I showed them my home and they met Bryan and Lou, they crazy guys I'm living with! <img class="aligncenter wp-image-1167 size-large" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.crazyy.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768" /> We made a deal that we're going to meet in Vinh to spend a day on the beach together the next day! The next thing I remember was being totally wasted and playing frisbee with amazing people on the stunning beach near Vinh, Cao Lo. The next day, we separated our ways as they were heading to the south and we needed to get back to our hometown.

The bike was named "Daisy the Nightrider", but I simply needed to rename it to PEGLICA! <em><strong>By now, I invested 800k VND and it's one of the fastest and loudest bikes around! </strong></em> <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/e9vBFO_2ZeQ" width="764" height="430" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>

		<Content><![CDATA[Vietnam is a beautiful country that is surprisingly cheap to travel in! You heard that right; you can experience Vietnam on a budget, and still get the most out of your trip! Even before departing to Vietnam, we estimated that a one-month journey from Hanoi to Ho Chi Minh City would cost us <strong>500$ per head</strong>. We were really close to that number, and it’s impressive just how much you can get and experience here for such a low budget! Our budget was calculated with the help of <a href="https://toshl.com/app"><b>this fantastic app</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">! </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Give it a try! If you honestly want to do Vietnam on a budget, taking a <strong>motorbike trip through the country</strong> is an ideal way to stick to the budget or the mid-range category of expenses. This way, it will absolutely make you embrace the local culture and teach you more about the people and their lifestyle here. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><em>So, planning a budget trip through Vietnam?</em></strong> We’ll give you all the necessary information regarding the budget while experiencing this magnificent country on a motorbike! </span>
<h2><b>Which Currency Should I Use in Vietnam?</b></h2>
<img class="wp-image-1324 size-full aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.vietnam-currency.jpg" alt="The main currency in Vietnam is Vietnamese Dong. Fun fact: Uncle Ho is on every banknote!" width="768" height="576" />
<div class="image_description"><em>The main currency in Vietnam is Vietnamese Dong. Fun fact: Uncle Ho is on every banknote!</em></div>
First things first, when you arrive on one of the main airports in Vietnam, we recommend you to buy Vietnamese Dong. You may ask yourself, why? After all, many locals in the big cities will gladly accept the US dollar. Well, if you decide to travel around Vietnam by motorbike, you will pass through many villages that will only accept the Vietnamese Dong.

<b><i>Note:</i></b><i> US Dollar has gotten stronger against the Vietnamese Dong than ever before! But ‘fraid not, the conversion rate isn’t that scary! 1 USD roughly equals 23,235 VND.</i>

You can convert your money to Vietnamese Dong on the airport or in the numerous bank branches. They will give you a fair exchange rate. You can also try out the exchange shops, but beware! Some will try to rip you off! <img class="wp-image-1326 size-full aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.vietnam-airports.jpg" alt="Airports are the safest place to exchange dollars to dong." width="4160" height="2340" />
<div class="image_description"><em>Airports are the safest place to exchange dollars to dong.</em></div>
The amount of zeroes the local currency has will confuse you at first, but believe me; you’ll get used to it fast enough! Still, we would recommend you to <strong>leave some extra US Dollars</strong> for the big cities (Hanoi, Da Nang, Nha Trang, Ho Chi Minh City).
<h2><b>How Much Money Did We Actually Spend? (~$11,93 per day)</b></h2>
On our motorbike trip, David and Lovel had a tourist visa lasting one month. They overstayed four days in Vietnam due to a late domestic flight from Ho Chi Minh City to Hanoi. <em>Oops!</em> We don’t recommend you to overstay your visa, but if you get in this situation, their immigration office won’t give you much trouble if you overstay for a few days. Also, a situation like this will most likely end up as a positive one if you just get into that perspective! David spent a <b>total of 14,700,930 Vietnamese Dong</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. That’s equal to </span><b>$632,14</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by current exchange rates. This budget is based on the cost of living in Vietnam while on the road for one month. We excluded the visa costs and flight costs. <img class="size-full wp-image-1215 aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.overall-budget-graph.jpg" alt="Overall trip budget per head - in graphic format!" width="704" height="532" /></span>
<div class="image_description"><em>Overall trip budget per head - in graphic format!</em></div>
Based on our total costs, let’s dive in the expense categories to give you a picture on what we spent the most and least on our motorbike trip!
<h2><b>Food Cost in Vietnam (~$4,95 per day)</b></h2>
<img class="size-full wp-image-1254 aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20180802_190556.jpg" alt="Banh Khoai" width="4160" height="2340" />
<div class="image_description"><em>The delicious Banh Khoai pancakes!</em></div>
Ah, the food in Vietnam. It’s delicious, diverse, and cheap! Actually one of the cheapest in South East Asia! <em><strong>From the traditional Pho rice noodle soup to Banh Mi baguette sandwiches to tasty seafood, there is something for every taste.</strong></em> How cheap is the food in Vietnam though? Based on our expenses, we spent roughly <b>$262 or 6,105,857 Vietnamese Dong</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">That was enough to fill up our bellies for three times a day. Most of our meals were in the little restaurants that locals have. Street food is fresh, cheap and by eating it, you’re also supporting the locals! <img class="wp-image-1328 size-full aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.street-food-vietnam-1.jpg" alt="Street food in Vietnam is the cheapest option." width="4160" height="2340" /></span>
<div class="image_description"><em>Street food in Vietnam is the cheapest option.</em></div>
We also visited the “regular” (“westernized”, “tourist-friendly”) restaurants in Phong Nha and in Hue where food prices were much higher and tailored to tourist budget. So, if you want to eat in Vietnam on a budget, <strong>we recommend the street food</strong>.

<b><i>Note:</i></b><i> I can’t stress this enough, but when you’re eating street food, <strong>always ask for the price</strong> before you order it! Just ask “bow nyew” (“how much?”), and you can agree on the price. We forgot to do this many times and in some cases got ripped off a bit! (Not too much though, the food costs are meager!)</i> What are the regular prices for the food though? It mostly depends on where you are.

<i>For example, in Hanoi Old Quarter, we paid 55,000 Dong ($2,36) for a bowl of Pho soup. You can get the same in the suburban part of the town for as little as 30,000 Dong ($1,29), and it will most likely be of higher quality. In highway villages, the food prices are generally lower than in cities.</i>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">The traditional Pho soup will cost from <strong>30,000 - 45,000 Vietnamese Dong ($1,29 - $1,94)</strong>.</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Banh Mi is usually <strong>10,000 - 20,000 Vietnamese Dong ($0,43 - $0,86)</strong>.</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">There is also the delicious Mi Xao, a rice noodle dish that you can spice up with chili sauce and soy sauce (everything rice related is so much better with soy sauce, it’s very addictive!). Expect to pay anywhere between <strong>30,000 - 50,000 Vietnamese Dong for that ($1,29 - $2,15)</strong>.</li>
</ul>
Anyway, there is so much great food out there in Vietnam that we could dedicate an entire article to it! <img class="size-full wp-image-1256 aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.pho-soup.jpg" alt="The iconic Pho soup is quite delicious!" width="1600" height="1200" />
<div class="image_description"><em>The iconic Pho soup is quite delicious!</em></div>

<div class="image_description"><em>The Spring Rolls were an extraordinary surprise to our taste glands!</em></div>
<img class="size-full wp-image-1258 aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20180808_131756.jpg" alt="Seafood in Vietnam is awesome! But, it may not be for every taste." width="4160" height="2340" />
<div class="image_description"><em>Seafood in Vietnam is awesome! But, it may not be for every taste.</em></div>
The bottom line is, food in Vietnam is very affordable, and you can enjoy the diverse Vietnamese cuisine for <b>as little as $4,95 per day</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">! </span>
<h2><b>Drink Costs in Vietnam (~$2,91 per day)</b></h2>
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1329 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.bia-saigon.jpg" alt="Bia Saigon" width="4608" height="3456" /> <em><strong>If you’re a coffee lover, you’ll absolutely enjoy Vietnam.</strong></em> It has a strong coffee culture, and cafes are literally everywhere - in the cities, on the road; you name it, there’s a cafe! The beer culture in Vietnam is also very strong, and there is nothing better than the sip of fresh iced beer when it’s smoking hot outside! Local people enjoy taking some time off in the afternoon for <em>siesta</em> time to enjoy in the sip of coffee and just observing what is going around the neighborhood. As we Balkan people enjoy taking some time off, especially when we were on the road; we made coffee breaks our routine very soon.

We roughly spent <b>$154 or 3,581,395 Vietnamese Dong</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on drinks. That includes: </span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Coffee (Cà Phê)</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Beer (Bia)</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Tea (Trà)</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Water (Nước)</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Sugar Cane Juice (Nước Mía)</li>
</ul>
As it’s very humid in most parts of Vietnam during the low season, coffee is served with ice! This makes it incredibly refreshing, and the taste of it is exceptional! The <a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/vietnamese-drip-coffee-guide"><b>process of making drip coffee</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is incredibly satisfying! Expect to pay for coffee with ice somewhere between </span><b>10,000 - 20,000 Vietnamese Dong ($0,43 - $0,86)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. As it was with food prices, you can expect to pay 30,000 Vietnamese Dong for coffee in the hot tourist zones. Also, egg coffee tends to be more expensive than iced coffee. <img class="size-full wp-image-1213 aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20180722_113104.jpg" alt="Iced coffee is just what you need to cool down and recharge for the day ahead!" width="4160" height="2340" /></span>
<div class="image_description"><em>Iced coffee is just what you need to cool down and recharge for the day ahead!</em></div>
Beer is incredibly cheap in Vietnam. Expect to pay <b>9,000 - 20,000 Vietnamese Dong ($0,39 - $0,86)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for 0,3 liters of fresh beer. Make sure to ask ice with your beer; it will make it so much better! If you’re buying beer in the supermarket, it’s usually cheaper than in cafes </span><b>(10,000 - 15,000 Vietnamese Dong or $0,43 - $0,65)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. <img class="wp-image-1330 size-full aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.vietnam-beer-1.jpg" alt="Fresh and dirt-cheap beer on the beach - the perfect combination!" width="4488" height="3455" /></span>
<div class="image_description"><em>Fresh and dirt-cheap beer on the beach - the perfect combination!</em></div>
Tea is served everywhere in Vietnam. In most places, <strong>you will get tea for free</strong> with coffee or with your meal. Mostly it’s a sort of green tea that is iced (in Highlands, they serve it warm, as it’s noticeably colder there than in the rest of Vietnam). <img class="wp-image-1331 size-full aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.vietnam-tea.jpg" alt="Tea is often served along with coffee - for free!" width="4608" height="3456" />
<div class="image_description"><em>Tea is often served along with coffee - for free!</em></div>
Tea won’t be served for free in regular restaurants, but don’t expect to pay much even there!

<b><i>Note:</i></b><i> In most cafes or restaurants you will see a plastic jug filled with tea. Feel free to treat yourself, as it’s free, fresh and tasty!</i> Tap water in Vietnam isn’t safe to drink yet. That means that you’ll have to buckle up on bottled water. Thankfully, you can buy bottled water virtually anywhere, as there will always be a stand beside the road or in the towns that have water on sale. Bottled water isn’t that expensive, and we recommend you to stock up on it; you’re going to need it!

The prices range from <b>9,000 - 12,000 Vietnamese Dong ($0,39 - $0,65)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><b><i>Note:</i></b><i> We recommend you to re-use those plastic bottles instead of throwing them away. In most street food stalls or cafes, there will be a plastic water barrel with a little faucet that you can use to fill up your bottles for free!</i> Sugar cane juice was an exciting discovery while traveling through Vietnam. It’s an incredibly refreshing drink that really fits great in the moments when you just want to relax and freshen up. Sugar cane juice is made in front of your eyes by crushing the sugar canes with a little crushing machine. <img class="size-full wp-image-1216 aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20180802_144219.jpg" alt="Stop by for some Nước Mía to freshen up on the road!" width="4160" height="2340" /></span>
<div class="image_description"><em>Stop by for some Nước Mía to freshen up on the road!</em></div>
When you get the sugar cane juice handed over to you, expect to pay <b>10,000 Vietnamese Dong ($0,43)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for one glass! Depending on your style, you may allocate more budget on the beverages than us, but either way, it won’t hurt your wallet at all. That’s the charm of experiencing Vietnam on a budget! </span>
<h2><b>Accommodation Cost in Vietnam (~$5,72 per day)</b></h2>
<img class="wp-image-1332 size-full aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.trang-an-nature-house.jpg" alt="The definition of the 5$ view?" width="4608" height="3456" />
<div class="image_description"><em>The definition of the 5$ view?</em></div>
Taking a motorbike road trip and finding the right accommodation is easier than ever thanks to the wonders of the Internet. In most cases, we three used the <a href="https://www.booking.com"><b>Booking app</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to find budget-friendly accommodation throughout our road trip. <em><strong>From cheap, 2-3-star hotels and hostels to homestays with friendly hosts, there is something to choose for every budget!</strong> </em></span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"> If you travel alone, the accommodation costs will be the most significant daily expenses in Vietnam. <em><strong>But, if you don’t travel alone, you can split those costs! Awesome, isn’t it?</strong></em> Most foreigners stay in hostels, so it’s an excellent way for a solo traveler to meet some potential travel partners! <img class="wp-image-1333 size-full aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.Phan-Thiet-bungalows.jpg" alt="The bungalows in Phan Thiet are a bang for you buck!" width="4608" height="3456" /></span>
<div class="image_description"><em>The bungalows in Phan Thiet are a bang for you buck!</em></div>
The accommodation costs are extra cheap (not the most affordable in Asia though!), especially when split between three people. <span style="font-weight: 400;">We roughly spent </span><b>$128 or 2,976,744 Vietnamese Dong</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on the accommodation for 30 days on the road. We’ve stayed in: </span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Hostels</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Homestays</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Guesthouses</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Hotels</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Bungalows</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Volunteer Houses</li>
</ul>
Also, the quality of budget accommodation is also on the level, most of the places where we’ve stayed in offered more value for spent money. Remember, you’re just spending <strong>$5 on average per night</strong>! Most of them offer <strong>free breakfast in the early morning hours</strong> (between 7 A.M. and 10 A.M.) and of course, free Wi-Fi! <img class="wp-image-1334 size-full aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.C4C-House.jpg" alt="The C4C volunteer house in Hanoi has a hammock on the balcony!" width="4160" height="2340" />
<div class="image_description"><em>The C4C volunteer house in Hanoi has a hammock on the balcony!</em></div>
<b><i>Note:</i></b><i> We stayed for free in volunteer houses in Hanoi and Cau Giat. </i><a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/starlight-english-center-vietnam"><b><i>Volunteering while traveling in Vietnam</i></b></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a great way to experience the local culture and save lots of money! All thanks go to </span></i><a href="http://c4c.vn/"><b><i>C4C </i></b></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">to their hospitality and extra-friendly attitude!</span></i> What amazed us the most is how the hospitality industry has developed here in Vietnam! The hosts of the places we’ve stayed in were generally warm, friendly and eager to help out at any time!

<b><i>Note:</i></b><i> Be careful of the check-in and check-out times! Some people will try to get more money out of your wallet if you check-out later than the designated time. Of course, you can bargain your way out of this situation as with most of the similar cases in Vietnam!</i> Some of the experiences with the various accommodation staff or shalomas, as we loved to call them on this trip:
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Drinking rice wine with bungalow staff in Cau Giat after the night of heavy partying with the volunteer crew!</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Getting a bag of weed for free!</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">The guy in Hue making the table for breakfast and getting the Banh Mi in two minutes!</li>
</ul>
In summary, accommodation costs in Vietnam are ridiculously low, especially when you take the superb hospitality (in most cases!), tidy rooms (in most cases too!) and the extra services you get into the price. <img class="wp-image-1335 size-full aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.da-nang-rooftops.jpg" alt="When you get a rooftop all for yourself for 5$, you know that's a great deal!" width="4608" height="3456" />
<div class="image_description"><em>When you get a rooftop all for yourself for 5$, you know that's a great deal!</em></div>
<em><strong>Note:</strong> In most of the places we've stayed in, we noticed that there are one-time use toothbrushes and toothpaste!</em> I’ve been to 5x more expensive accommodations in Europe that offered fewer services than in Vietnam, so this was really a breath of fresh air!
<h2><b>Motorbike Price and Maintenance Costs in Vietnam</b></h2>
<em><strong>What would be a motorbike trip without actually buying the motorbikes first?</strong></em> Thankfully, Vietnam is swarming with bikes, and that means that supply and demand are ridiculously high! That also means that finding an affordable motorbike is very easy. But, if you want to ride over 1,000 kilometers through Vietnam, you certainly need to <strong>find a reliable bike</strong>.

During our first days in Hanoi, our primary goal was to find reliable bikes. There are a lot of bike shops all over Hanoi that have automatic, semi-automatic and manual bikes on sale. Anything you want really!

<strong>Learn more: <a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/buy-motorbike-in-vietnam">How to buy the bike that won't breakdown in the middle of nowhere?</a></strong>

In the end, we got contacted by an awesome dude called Leo who had an automatic and semi-automatic bike for sale. To be exact: SYM Atilla and Honda Wave. We purchased <b>SYM Atilla for $200 and Honda Wave for $350</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. David also got a helmet with his bike. <img class="wp-image-1336 size-full aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.atilla-honda-peglica.jpg" alt="Our three machines: Atilla, Honda and Peglica!" width="4608" height="3456" /></span>
<div class="image_description"><em>Our three machines: Atilla, Honda and Peglica!</em></div>
<i>This </i><a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/882003845187734/"><b><i>group </i></b></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">will help you if you want to buy a reliable motorbike!</span></i> We were delighted with these bikes, as we went through various obstacles like poor road constructions, off-road driving through heavy rain, driving through mud; without any major breakdown! <em>Also, when you can tame the Central Highlands and the Ho Chi Minh Trail with a 14-year old automatic scooter, you know that you invested smartly!</em>

On the other hand, <a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/motorbike-in-vietnam"><b>Antonio got his Honda Win as a gift</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We had the most problems with his bike, as it broke down every once in a while. But, still, the cost of rapidly repairing this bike was still lower than the actual price of Honda Win. Regarding the maintenance part of the motorbike trip, the essential things are <strong>fuel and oil</strong>. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The gas tank on our motorbikes were roughly 7 liters, so, we had to fill up every 120 - 150 kilometers. Gas price in Vietnam is ridiculously low, compared to our home country of Croatia. Expect to pay about <strong>20,000 Vietnamese Dong ($0,86)</strong> for a liter of fuel. That makes it extremely affordable to take a motorbike trip around Vietnam on a budget! <img class="wp-image-1337 size-full aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.gas-pump.jpg" alt="Make sure to fill up your bikes every once in a while on the trusty gas pump!" width="4160" height="2340" /></span>
<div class="image_description"><em>Make sure to fill up your bikes every once in a while on the trusty gas pump!</em></div>
Also, gas stations are always around! Except in Central Highlands and on Ho Chi Minh Trail; make sure to <strong>fill up a few bottles with fuel</strong> if you don’t want to get stranded in the middle of nowhere! We spent roughly <b>$86,71 or 2,015,512 Vietnamese Dong</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for filling up the juice on our motorbikes. Very affordable and yet another encouragement to try out an adventure like this one! We also mentioned the second pillar of the motorbike maintenance sphere - oil. You have to <strong>change engine oil every 500 - 1000 kilometers</strong> for your engine to work correctly. </span>
<div class="image_description"><em>The Xe May workshops will gladly check your bike and change engine oil.</em></div>
You can change oil at any motorbike shop (when you see “XE MAY” on the post, you’re at the right place!). Changing oil will roughly cost you <strong>100,000 Vietnamese Dong ($4,3)</strong>. We had to change engine oil two times, which cost us roughly <b>$9,52 or 221,395 Vietnamese Dong</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. What’s the most charming about taking a motorbike trip in Vietnam is that the bikes are insanely easy to sell, as the demand is enormous. David sold his bike after negotiating for <strong>$190</strong>, which was a decent sell. Antonio managed to sell his bike for <strong>$110</strong>, which was even more than decent!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Motorbike trip is an optimal way to experience Vietnam on a budget, so the right time to do this is now! </span>
<h2><b>Other Expenses in Vietnam</b></h2>
Of course, you will need to consider other expenses while motorbiking around Vietnam. If you’re coming to visit in the low season, make sure to invest in a quality raincoat, as you’re going to put it on a lot. When you’re driving through a rainstorm (that are very frequent during low season) it’s a lifesaver, believe us! <img class="wp-image-1339 size-full aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.Vietnam-Raincoat.jpg" alt="Vietnam Raincoat" width="4160" height="2340" />
<div class="image_description"><em>It's sunshine and rainbows at one moment; blink once and here comes the rain!</em></div>
We invested <b>150,000 Vietnamese Dong ($6,45)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in a quality raincoat each, and they got us through the whole trip from Hanoi to HCMC. Also, make sure to get some bungee cords for your luggage. A bungee cord should cost no more than </span><b>10,000 Vietnamese Dong ($0,43)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It will make all the difference regarding your luggage transport on the motorbike. <img class="wp-image-1340 size-full aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.bungee-cords-motorbike.jpg" alt="Bungee cords will keep your stuff safe on the back of your bike." width="4608" height="3456" /></span>
<div class="image_description"><em>Bungee cords will keep your stuff safe on the back of your bike.</em></div>
<b><i>Note:</i></b><i> You may need to invest in a luggage rack if it isn’t already there on the bike, so pay attention to that!</i> Other than using the motorbike, you will also need to use other transportation means in Vietnam. We recommend getting the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.grabtaxi.passenger&amp;hl=hr"><b>Grab app</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which is the equivalent of the Uber app in South East Asia. It’s much cheaper than a taxi (especially when sharing a ride). </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Buses are also a cheap way to travel around Hanoi. We used them in a few occasions to get to the city, and the ticket cost only </span><b>5,000 Vietnamese Dong ($0,22)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. <b><i>Note:</i></b><i> Watch out for “freelance” motorbike taxis! If you end up on one of them, make sure to agree on the price before the ride if you don’t want to get ripped off!</i> </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><em>Willing to check out some of the attractions along the way?</em></strong> You’ll have to single out some money for a ticket. The Paradise Cave complex ticket in Phong Nha National Park costs </span><b>250,000 Vietnamese Dong ($10,82)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and it’s absolutely worth it! <img class="wp-image-1341 size-full aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.phong-nha-jungle.jpg" alt="The Phong Nha hides many a thing in its lush jungle." width="4608" height="3456" /></span>

<div class="image_description"><em>Paradise Cave in Phong Nha National Park features the dramatic work of nature.</em></div>
The ticket for the Hue Imperial City costs <b>150,000 Vietnamese Dong ($6,45)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that includes the majority of the Imperial City (minus the tombs). <img class="wp-image-1343 size-full aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.imperial-city-hue.jpg" alt="The Imperial City in Hue is a very interesting place.

<div class="image_description"><em>The Imperial City in Hue is a very interesting place. Magnificent architecture attracts a fair share of tourists though.</em></div>
The Abandoned Water Park in Hue is a different story though. Us three got in by bribing a “security guard” for <b>100,000 Vietnamese Dong ($4,3)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> regardless the fact that the park is officially closed, but the locals have used the situation to earn some money I guess! <img class="wp-image-1344 size-full aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.hue-abandoned-water-park.jpg" alt="You get to explore inside this huge dragon that dominates the Abandoned Water Park in Hue." width="4608" height="3456" /></span>
<div class="image_description"><em>You get to explore inside this huge dragon that dominates the Abandoned Water Park in Hue.</em></div>
After driving on a motorbike for a month, getting a massage is a must! We managed to bargain out a full body massage in Phan Thiet with the duration of 1 hour for <b>100,000 Vietnamese Dong ($4,30)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It was truly well worth the money, we must say! You’re a passionate cigarette smoker and don’t plan on quitting any time soon? Good news for you, as the cigarettes in Vietnam are dirt-cheap! A single 20-pack will cost you from </span><b>20,000 - 30,000 Dong ($0,86 - $1,29)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. <img class="wp-image-1345 size-full aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.vietnam-cigarettes.jpg" alt="Cigarettes in Vietnam are damn cheap! Watch out for chain-smoking though!" width="4608" height="3456" /></span>
<div class="image_description"><em>Cigarettes in Vietnam are damn cheap! Watch out for chain-smoking though!</em></div>
If you’re a cannabis smoker, you’ll be happy by the fact that you can get weed quite easily in Vietnam (even though the law is strict regarding drugs). The price goes higher with the quality, and the lowest that we have paid for it was <b>500,000 Vietnamese Dong ($21,50)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for bush </span><b>weed in Da Nang</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. <img class="size-full wp-image-1225 aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.weed-in-vietnam.jpg" alt="Weed in Vietnam is really easy to get!" width="2340" height="2583" /></span>
<div class="image_description"><em>Weed in Vietnam is really easy to get!</em></div>
<b><i>Note:</i></b><i> In bigger cities, like </i><b><i>Hanoi</i></b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span></i><b><i>HCMC</i></b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and Hue, you may get approached by cannabis dealers. Mostly, they will offer you low-quality weed for a high price, so try to bargain out a reasonable deal or back out of the deal. Also, we’ve seen some shady people offering prostitutes and “happy ending massages” too! Make sure to rationalize these deals and take them with a grain of salt before deciding what to do. We are not promoting these "diversions" in any way!</span></i> There are a lot of possibilities for getting cannabis in <b>Hoi An</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><b>Mui Ne</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> too. Simply use your common sense, and there won't be any problems with the authorities as cannabis is generally accepted here in Vietnam. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Cannabis smoker in Vietnam? Check out our <a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/cannabis-in-vietnam">cannabis guide for Vietnam</a> and <a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/weed-in-hanoi">getting weed in Hanoi</a>.</strong> Anyway, these are some of the other expenses you may consider while traveling Vietnam on a budget. Having a motorbike eliminates most of the public transport costs, so you save a lot of money on that front. </span>
<h2><b>How Would You Rank The Locations By the Expenses?</b></h2>
Now, this ranking is mainly subjective, as we obviously didn’t have enough time to experience every destination fully. So, here is the ranking, in descending order:
<h3><b>1. Hanoi - 706,333 Vietnamese Dong (~$30) per day</b></h3>
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1346 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.Hanoi-1.jpg" alt="Hanoi" width="4160" height="2340" /> Hanoi was the most costly of our destinations, as it was our first destination where we had to buy the bikes and all the necessary gear for the motorbike trip. Anyway, Hanoi is more expensive the more you head into the city center, so keep that information in mind.
<h3><b>2. Tam Coc - 672,132 Vietnamese Dong (~$29) per day</b></h3>
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1347 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.Tam-Coc-2.jpg" alt="Tam Coc" width="4608" height="3456" /> You can significantly lower your daily costs if you stay and explore the Ninh Binh city. We were cruising around Tam Coc and visited the Mua Caves (you have to pay an entry ticket) and spent most of our money on the breakfast and dinner at our hostel.
<h3><b>3. Phong Nha - 660,533 Vietnamese Dong (~$28) per day</b></h3>
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1348 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.Phong-Nha-1.jpg" alt="Phong Nha" width="4608" height="3456" /> You can find cheap accommodation in Phong Nha, but there are a lot of restaurants that are more expensive than the local ones. If you want to pay less for food in Phong Nha, just venture to any of nearby villages. Also, be prepared to fill up your gas tank, as the road to all the attractions in the national park (for some, you have to pay an entry ticket) begs to be explored!
<h3><b>4. Ho Chi Minh City - 638,000 Vietnamese Dong (~$27) per day</b></h3>
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1349 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.Saigon-1.jpg" alt="Saigon" width="4160" height="2340" /> We overspent a bit in HCMC as we booked our hostel while we were on the road toll. When you stay in District 1, be prepared to bargain a lot more as you will have vendors that sell 0,3-liter beer for 30,000 Vietnamese Dongs and a modest rice meal for 60,000 Vietnamese Dong (usually, you can get it for 30,000 Vietnamese Dong). <strong>Learn more: <a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/scams-in-vietnam">Avoiding scams in Vietnam!</a></strong>
<h3><b>5. Ha Long - 608,667 Vietnamese Dong (~$26) per day</b></h3>
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1350 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.Ha-Long-1.jpg" alt="Ha Long" width="4608" height="3456" /> The beautiful Ha Long Bay can be experienced on a low budget and offer you an authentic experience. We avoided boat tours that are mostly tailored to higher touristic budgets. Instead, we drove to the beach, got some beers, and enjoyed the Bay for ourselves! Also, we spent more money on getting the necessary supplies for our motorbike road trip in the shopping mall. <strong>Halong on a budget: <a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/halong-bay-vietnam">Climb a stunning Bai Tho mountain!</a></strong>
<h3><b>6. Nha Trang - 523,000 Vietnamese Dong (~$22) per day</b></h3>
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1351 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.Nha-Trang.jpg" alt="Nha Trang" width="4160" height="2340" /> Nha Trang is an exciting beach city that is filled with local and foreign tourists alike. But as with every city in Vietnam, you can squeeze it out on a budget, if you know where to look!
<h3><b>7. Phan Thiet/Mui Ne - 499,500 Vietnamese Dong (~$21) per day</b></h3>
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1352 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.Phan-Thiet.jpg" alt="Phan Thiet" width="4608" height="3456" /> Phan Thiet is a perfect place just to lay back and relax. The beach vibes, huge waves, and nice party atmosphere really came in handy to recharge at the end of our road trip. There are a lot of restaurants with great prices, massage parlors, fruit vendors and more. What’s amazing is all of that is just on one street!
<h3><b>8. Da Nang - 492,250 Vietnamese Dong (~$21) per day</b></h3>
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1353 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.Da-Nang-1.jpg" alt="Da Nang " width="4608" height="3456" /> Living in Da Nang for four days was an awesome experience. The food is generally very cheap, and we stayed in one of the cheapest hostels on our road trip that offered huge value for our money! The beach is very close to the city center. We would say that it was the most liveable city in Vietnam so far. Make sure to check out Mỹ Sơn that is very close to Da Nang!
<h3><b>9. Kon Tum - 487,000 Vietnamese Dong (~$21) per day</b></h3>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1239" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_2188.jpg" alt="Kon Tum" width="4608" height="3456" /> This town in the Central Highlands is special. Not just that it’s much colder than the coastline, but the people are also different. There is a lot to see in Kon Tum and in the villages around it, and it’s perfectly suited to a motorbike cruise!
<h3><b>10. Hoi An - 454,000 Vietnamese Dong (~$20) per day</b></h3>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1240" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20180809_182233.jpg" alt="Hoi An" width="4160" height="2340" /> Hoi An is a place where you have to watch out to not behave like a tourist. It attracts a lot of foreign people every year, and the locals know that; so there is aggressive marketing everywhere! In the outer town areas, you can find some great accommodation for low prices.
<h3><b>11. Hue - 434,000 Vietnamese Dong (~$19) per day</b></h3>
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1354 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.Hue-1.jpg" alt="Hue" width="4608" height="3456" /> The former capital of Vietnam has a lot of options for budget travelers. The daily cost is amplified with tickets to Imperial City and Abandoned Waterpark and eating out in the westernized restaurant.
<h3><b>12. Quy Nhon - 409,000 Vietnamese Dong (~$18) per day</b></h3>
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1355 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.Quy-Nhon.jpg" alt="Quy Nhon" width="4608" height="3456" /> A calm beach town that is surprisingly affordable and off the radar for many travelers coming in Vietnam!
<h3><b>13. Cau Giat - 209,833 Vietnamese Dong (~$9) per day </b></h3>
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1356 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.Cau-Giat-1.jpg" alt="Cau Giat" width="4160" height="2340" /> These are the daily costs that you can expect while staying in highway villages of Vietnam. Great beach, cheap accommodation and food, and excellent coconut coffee! This is the place where the volunteer community is growing.

<hr />

In the end, we surpassed our estimated budget of $500 by almost $150! We made some mistakes on the road, but it was definitely a learning experience. Nevertheless, you can definitely experience Vietnam on a budget, even lower than ours if you opt-out some of the costs like alcohol and weed.  The tourism industry is still in growth stages, so the <strong>prices are still very affordable</strong>.

Also, make sure to <strong>avoid hot tourist zones</strong> if you want to make it out on a low budget. Who knows, you might learn something from a local perspective… We would definitely do some things differently regarding the budget, but the bottom line is - even if you make mistakes, you won't get ripped off that much if you <strong>use common sense</strong> in most situations.

<em><strong>Experiencing Vietnam on a motorbike is an ultimate way to explore this beautiful country, and the time to do it is now when it's still untouched by mass tourism!</strong></em>

		<Content><![CDATA[Buying a motorbike in Vietnam and exploring the beauties of the country sounds like the adventure you'd like to jump on? If you think that it's nearly impossible, just stop a bit and continue reading! Finding a bike in Vietnam is very easy since the country has around 45 million registered motorcycles on a population of roughly 90 million people! <em>It roughly means that every second person has a bike, or better said - every bike serves (at least!) two people! How crazy is it, right?</em>

Don’t get excited too soon, as finding the reliable motorbike that will be your true companion around the country can cause few headaches! Locals around the city mainly use motorbikes as the mean of transportation as they don’t usually travel long distances, so the bikes are in better condition than your average ‘<em>backpacker</em>’ motorbike.

We have the experience of buying and maintaining three different bikes and driving a few other bikes. Nothing is certain on the road except one thing - BREAKDOWNS!!!

<em>There were many breakdowns in the middle of nowhere, oil leaks, flat tires, you name it!</em>

We want to share bits of knowledge we gathered from driving 5,000kms around this stunning country and help you in picking the suitable motorbike for your trip! <em>…because a breakdown in the middle of nowhere isn’t funny at all!</em>
<h2><strong>Where to Buy a Motorbike in Vietnam</strong></h2>
<img class="aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.37647027_10215366678136646_2249191630370242560_o-min.jpg" alt="Buying a motorbike in Hanoi" /> You will most likely start your trip in either Hanoi or Ho Chi Minh City (Saigon) and these cities are the biggest hubs of backpackers and also the major starting point for travelers who’re about to travel Vietnam by motorbike. The motorbike market in these two cities is huge which can be very tricky as you can choose between million bikes! We didn’t have any prior mechanic experience when it comes to motorbikes, so it was a bit tougher to pick a reliable bike. We had a bit of luck to have prior experience in Vietnam with motorbikes and many local friends, so we were poured with a dozen of advice when it comes to buying the bike.

The usual advice is to buy a motorbike in Hanoi and sell it in Ho Chi Minh city. The reason is that China is nearer to Hanoi and many bikes are coming from China, so the price is lower as there are not as many logistics costs as in Saigon. People will tell you that you can even earn money by <a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/sell-motorbike-vietnam" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">selling the motorbike</a> in Saigon. It wasn't our case! A bit of money was lost, but nothing significant! We didn’t have much trouble when buying a motorbike in Hanoi, and it took us one afternoon to do a test drive and close a deal.

We posted on the Facebook group called <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/882003845187734/?jazoest=2651001198210198991078266688476521208145121871005072709710597771068410795721211036611711111011757121104508065655865100121671179812084106887352112104871148310185109108827166709056538110772498385995474697287997810712171119" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vietnam Backpackers Travel and Sales</a> that we’re looking for a motorbike, and we were showered with deals in a few minutes. We decided to check a Mr. Leo agency as the guy had one automatic and a semi-automatic motorbike at the time. We spent around 3 hours checking the bikes and doing test drives since David never drove anything except a bicycle.

Anyway, it was a successful afternoon as we got two bikes and we were ready for our motorbike trip around Vietnam! So, to answer the question of where to buy a motorbike in Vietnam - it really doesn’t matter as you’ll probably going to start your journey from Saigon or Hanoi. The market is enormous in both cities, and you shouldn’t have any struggle while finding a motorbike in these cities. The best advice we can give you is to never to believe people who say that they never experienced a breakdown on the road!

<em>The chances for that are close to zero!</em>
<h2><strong>Reliable Motorbike Types in Vietnam</strong></h2>
There are so many different types of motorcycles in Vietnam, so sometimes it can be very confusing when picking a suitable motorbike for you. <em>Here are the most usual motorbikes travelers get for the Vietnamese trip:</em>
<h3><strong>Manual</strong></h3>
<img class="aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20180821_113837-min.jpg" alt="Manual Sufat Win" /> Backpackers usually go for ‘Honda’ Win. Please note that the original Honda Win is rare to find since Honda stopped to produce these bikes almost ten years ago. They sold that series to Chinese and Vietnamese companies, so now, you have many different versions of Win motorbike. None of these bikes is Honda since real Honda Win will cost you around $1000.

<strong><em>Funny fact:</em> </strong><a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/motorbike-in-vietnam" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Antonio got his bike as a gift in Hanoi!</a>

A ‘Honda’ Win’s usually goes from $150 - $500. We advise you to not go for the cheapest one since these bikes have so many kilometers under the belt and you can expect many breakdowns on the road with the cheapest ones. Instead, aim for the bikes that are in a $300 price range. You can get a decent manual bike in that range! There are many different brands of Wins now, but from experience, we think Sufat and new Detech (2016+)<strong> </strong>are the most reliable. Antonio was driving Sufat from Hanoi to Saigon without any significant problems on the machine. The only problem he had was the electric, so he had issues with starting a bike sometimes.

Also, the indicators usually don’t work on these bikes, so be careful when it comes to checking the fuel. His Sufat left him without the gas in the most remote areas a few times! Don’t be like Antonio and always fill your tank!
<h3><strong>Semi-automatic</strong></h3>
<img class="wp-image-5921 size-full aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5e8337ab695ff.jpg" alt="Semi automatic Honda Wave" width="1131" height="846" />
<div class="image_description">Honda Waves are very common bikes in Vietnam. This one is a crazy good bike and also, it's a real Honda so you should expect to pay a bit more. We didn't have much trouble with this one on the road.</div>
We found out that semi-automatic bikes are very reliable but slightly more expensive than manuals. Lovel was driving Honda Wave, and he didn’t have any major breakdowns except a broken chain and few problems with a gearbox that he changed on the road. The bike cruises like a charm, and you can easily reach 90 km/h which is ideal for many roads around the country.

The indicators work, so you don’t need to worry about fuel consumption. Also, the bike has a lot of strength so climbing the steep mountains won’t cause obstacles to a well-maintained Wave. The Waves are delightful and comfortable to drive, but be careful that you’re buying a real Honda since there are many versions of Chinese waves as Lifan.

Yamaha Sirius and Taurus are another good to go semi-automatic bikes, but they will cost a bit more, and their fuel consumption isn’t as good as Wave. So if you’re thinking about buying a semi-automatic, definitely go for a Wave.
<h3><strong>Automatic</strong></h3>
<img class="wp-image-5920 size-full aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5e833706da177.jpg" alt="SYM Atilla" width="1127" height="844" />
<div class="image_description">An automatic bike that was the most reliable bike of our crew! Not a single breakdown on the road. Just put the new oil every 1,000 km and tightening the chain.</div>
An automatic type of motorbike is the most suitable for total beginners who never had any experience with the bikes or people who don’t want to think about changing the gears while focusing on chaotic traffic around. Automatic bikes aren’t the most comfortable bikes and there is not much space, so prepare for a bent back and be ready to put some money for a massage here and there.

Also, when hitting the hills with an automatic, you will obviously have a much harder time as you have no control over the transmission. Driving on the challenging Ho Chi Minh Trail was really slow on this bike. David was driving SYM Atilla along the way and he passed 3,500 km with the bike without a single breakdown! Without a single breakdown, you heard it right!

He even didn’t have a flat tire or broken chain. Literally nothing except changing the oil every 1,000 kilometers. Here and there, you may end up with some slight issues with the electric starter, but that's not a permanent issue. Also, scooters have a kickstart for situations like this. If you’re thinking about getting an automatic bike, then we advise you to go with SYM Atilla or Honda Lead (a bit more expensive) as these bikes are very reliable, but once they break down, you will have a hard time to find a mechanic who can help you!
<h2><strong>Checklist Before Buying a Motorbike in Vietnam</strong></h2>
<img class="wp-image-5922 size-full aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5e833864e4408.jpg" alt="Resting the bike in the middle of nowhere" width="1134" height="844" />
<div class="image_description">We didn't have any mechanic knowledge before buying our motorbikes, but there are many things you can check on your own; even without any knowledge or experience about the bikes!</div>
These tips will definitely help people without any mechanic experience since we’re the same, but it turned out these things can save you a lot of time and money on the road, so let’s start:
<ul>
 	<li>Check the condition of both tires. You can put the price down if the tires are well-used and you should change the used tires as the roads can be very slippery in some sections.</li>
 	<li>Are front and rear signals working?</li>
 	<li>Are front and rear lights working? Does the brake indicator on the back work?</li>
 	<li>Always check out the condition of your horn and loudness level of it! It’s one of the most important things on your motorbike!</li>
 	<li>When doing a test drive, try out your brakes and get a feeling of tightness.</li>
 	<li>Try an electric starter as well as kickstarter.</li>
 	<li>Drive a bit and leave the motorbike on the stand. When the engine gets a bit warmer, you shouldn’t see any oil leaks below. If you notice any leaks after a short ride, it’s the sign that the engine isn’t in the best condition.</li>
 	<li>Put the bike on the center stand and rotate the rear wheel to see if it’s centered.</li>
 	<li>Drive in all gears and check out if there is an anomaly when changing the gears. The gears should change without much effort and you can also put in the neutral gear once you’re in 1st and 2nd gear (manual bikes).</li>
 	<li>Check out the suspension when you’re braking and also see if there is any rust or cracks. When you’re driving everything should be smooth without any wobbling and vibrations.</li>
 	<li>The bike shouldn’t have any sprayings on the machine since it can be an indicator that the seller is trying to hide a broken part from you.</li>
 	<li>Double-check the numbers on the blue card. Both numbers should match the machine and the case.</li>
</ul>
These tips can help you so much in filtering bad bikes! If the bike passed all the checks, then there is a huge possibility it’s the right bike you should buy for your trip. Another great tip when buying is to have a local friend who knows people and who can help you with negotiating the price. Believe us, the language barrier can be a deal-breaker here!
<h2><strong>Bike Accessories That Will Make Your Life Easier</strong></h2>
<p id="kIKrNbr"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5923 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5e83396293e31.jpg" alt="Luggage rack and bungees are crucial" width="1439" height="872" /></p>
There are some things that will save you a lot of time and hustle on the road if your bike has it. It’s not a major deal breaker if the bike doesn’t come with these things, but always ask for it, or bargain the price.
<ul>
 	<li>Bungee cords are necessary since you need to tie down your luggage to the rack. Head to local markets and get the strongest ones. Also, keep in mind cords tend to break, so always go for more. One cord costs up to 20,000 VND on the market.</li>
 	<li>Many sellers will usually give you a helmet with the bike, but the quality won't protect you at all. Invest in a proper full-face helmet!</li>
 	<li>A luggage rack is essential since you'll most likely carry luggage with you. Double-check for the rust and strength of the rack! You can get a new one for about 300,000 VND.</li>
 	<li>A cell phone holder comes handy since you can fix your phone and navigate without constant stopping. This is a major time saver!</li>
 	<li>Chain and a lock for the safety of your bike. This comes in handy when you’re doing day trips and you don’t park your bike in a safe place. In the big cities, thefts are common, so always secure your bike with the lock or park on the secured parking.</li>
</ul>
These are just some of the things that will ease up things a bit when you're on the road!
<h2><strong>Maintenance Before and On the Road</strong></h2>
<img class="wp-image-5924 size-full aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5e833a5d4a4b2.jpg" alt="Oil change in Vietnam" width="1409" height="897" />
<div class="image_description">Always be sure to have your oil level checked and don't forget to change the oil. It's cheap and it will give your bike enough juice to drive you through the most intense terrains around the country.</div>
Remember one thing when getting second-hand Vietnam motorcycles - these bikes passed the same trip you’re planning to do hundreds of times! Many bikes didn’t have proper maintenance and you want to be sure that you start off your trip right and check everything on your bike. <em>Here are the things we advise you to check and change before starting your epic ride:</em>
<ul>
 	<li>Change the oil and clean the engine (500 - 1,000 km)</li>
 	<li>Check out the mirrors and all the screws/bolts on the engine and frame</li>
 	<li>Test your brakes and adjust them if necessary. Also, changing the brake pads will help a lot!</li>
 	<li>Change plugs</li>
 	<li>Tighten and lubricate the chain</li>
</ul>
<em>TA-DA! Your motorbike is ready for the trip!</em> Once you hit the road, you don’t want to torture your ride. You should always take good care and visit a mechanic every once in a while. <em>Here are the maintenance things you should consider doing once you hit the road:</em>
<ul>
 	<li>Change the oil every 500 - 1000 km</li>
 	<li>When you change the oil, always tighten the chain and adjust the brakes</li>
 	<li>Put extra air to the tires and check out the condition of your tires</li>
 	<li>Check out the bolts and loose parts and tighten them</li>
</ul>
That’s it! Do these things and you are totally ready for this trip! Here are the costs of common repairs:
<ul>
 	<li>Oil change with chain lubricating, tightening and brake adjusting - up to 120k</li>
 	<li>Spark plug - 70k</li>
 	<li>Flat tire (inner tire) - 100k</li>
 	<li>Changing the inner and outer tire - 300k</li>
 	<li>Battery - 250k - 350k</li>
 	<li>Suspension - 300k</li>
 	<li>Brake pads - 100k</li>
 	<li>Exhaust - 250k</li>
 	<li>Front light - 200k</li>
 	<li>Backlight - 100k</li>
 	<li>Chain - 150k</li>
 	<li>Carburetor - 250k</li>
 	<li>Cylinder - 400k</li>
 	<li>Brake or clutch handle - 70k</li>
 	<li>Set of mirrors - 90k</li>
 	<li>Changing the clutch - 500k</li>
 	<li>Front rim - 300k</li>
 	<li>Back rim - 500k</li>
 	<li>Complete new gearbox - around 1 mil</li>
 	<li>Alternator - 200k</li>
</ul>
Always ask for the price upfront as a mechanic won’t be able to manipulate you on your ignorance. Once the price is set, the Vietnamese people respect it and they won’t change it. Just take a look at the prices above so you know what’s the usual price for the parts. With that knowledge, you’ll have a good starting point for bargaining.

		<Content><![CDATA[Driving around Vietnam by motorbike is one of the most meaningful experiences that put you in front of many challenges. The adventure you’ll experience is merely the thing you’re going to talk about for years and remember the moments with the smile on your face for a whole life. <strong><a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/buy-motorbike-in-vietnam">Once you’ve got your motorbike</a></strong> ready to hit the road, got all the accessories and things you might need, it’s time to talk about the laws and police in Vietnam. There are many talks on different groups between backpackers and locals about the traffic police in Vietnam.

It’s a significant topic to cover since there is a possibility that the traffic police will pull you over at some point of your trip.

Find a comfortable place, and read carefully as this guide will help you to avoid unwanted trouble or if inevitable, pay the <em>‘fine’</em> that is close to nothing.

<em>Let’s start with the type of the police…</em>
<h2><b>How Does the Traffic Police Look Like</b></h2>
<img class="size-full wp-image-1382 aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.traffic-police-in-vietnam.jpg" alt="Vietnamese traffic police" width="3504" height="2336" />
<div class="image_description"><em>Traffic police wear yellow uniforms, and you can see 'CSGT' on their vehicles, helmets, and uniforms.</em></div>
The most straightforward description of traffic police is <strong>yellow uniforms</strong>. Usually, you will see many police stops and controls in the big cities. They ensure that the traffic is flowing without interruptions. Sometimes they are staying in the middle of busy intersections and helping with the flow of traffic. The acronym for traffic police in Vietnam is CSGT. You can see that sign on their vehicles, helmets and checkpoint houses.

In the cities, there are many checkpoints where officers usually stay, checking the documents and pull over people. Their job is to enforce the traffic law and ensure proper traffic flow. Except for these duties, they can’t do anything more since the other responsibilities are delegated to another <strong><a href="https://www.citypassguide.com/en/travel/vietnam/blog/blog/how-to-identify-the-different-police-in-vietnam">type of police</a></strong>. Every police officer should have a blue ID card visible on the right part of the chest showing their name, rank, number, and department. Like in every country, if the police stop you, <strong>don’t forget to take a photo or write down details from their ID.</strong>
<h2><b>Most Usual Cases Why People Get Pulled Over</b></h2>
<img class="size-full wp-image-1385" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.Webp.net-resizeimage.jpg" alt="Don't forget to wear helmets and avoid alcohol on the road" width="1336" height="1002" />
<div class="image_description"><em>Don't forget to wear a helmet, and avoid alcohol on the road!</em></div>
<em>There are many cases why the police pull over people in Vietnam and one of the most common are:</em>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Not complying with the traffic rules</strong> - it usually includes driving through the red light, driving in the wrong direction, failure to use signals when taking a turn or speeding over the limit. Check out the list of fines for failing to follow the traffic rules.</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Regular traffic checks</strong> - police usually perform their checks in the big cities during the rush hours as there are many people in the traffic. Police randomly stop people to check the motorbike papers and licenses. You need to be sure that you have a valid <strong>Blue Card and international (Vietnamese) driving license</strong>! If you fail to show one of these, you will probably need to pay a fine, or a bribe or they can even confiscate your motorbike!</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Tourist traps</strong> - there are few tourist traps where police aim tourists to get the juicy bribes from them. We will talk about these places later in the article, and these are easy to avoid, so don’t worry so much!</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>No reason at all</strong> - yeah, that’s Vietnam, and it is usually the most common case! Police will stop you claiming you did something that you didn’t and try to get money from your pocket.</li>
</ul>
These four cases are the most common, and usually, you will experience one or more of these during your time driving around Vietnam. <em>Maybe it sounds like a horror story to you now, but don’t worry, you can avoid many of them or get out of the situation without much hustle!</em>
<h2><b>What to Do If You Get Pulled Over?</b></h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8odfKVx-pPg" width="764" height="430" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>

During our trip, Lovel was the only one who’s got pulled over by police. They let him go without any complications. We can say he was a lucky guy!

<em>So, what happens and what’s the process for not so lucky travelers?</em> Well, based on many stories and experiences from other travelers, no matter what’s the case police pulled you over, there are few possible scenarios.
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">When police pull you over, they will usually ask you for the documentation including a blue card and driving license. In the countryside, when the police see a foreigner, they will just wave you to go since <strong>the language barrier</strong> is real and it will take a lot of time to get some money from foreigners, so they usually don’t mind.</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">If you don’t have proper documents, they will ask you to pay the fine (without a ticket), and usually, they start with the price set on 1 mil. VND, but they <strong>settle for 200k or even less</strong>. This is the bribe, and it’s the easiest way to get away from the police since paying the ticket is the whole process, and you need to go to the station, fill the documents, and in the end pay much more money and lose so much time. If you can’t avoid spending the money while encountering the police, the best way may be paying the bribe.</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">When you settle everything with the officer, they will let you continue your trip!</li>
</ul>
The process is really that straightforward, and it won’t last for a long if police randomly stop you. If you’ve got stopped by a police trap, then expect to pay much more without bargaining for the price. Also, in police traps, there is a huge possibility that they will <strong>confiscate your motorbike</strong>.
<h2><b>How to Deal with Police Traps</b></h2>
<img class="size-full wp-image-1386 aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.prepare-dongs.jpg" alt="Prepare dongs to settle the situation" width="1280" height="853" />
<div class="image_description"><em>Prepare Dongs to settle the situation with the police. The bribes usually start from 200k VND!</em></div>
Simply avoid them! There is always an alternative route for police traps! They may be a bit longer, but ultimately it will save you time and money. <em>What happens if you get stopped by a police trap?</em> Well, you’re not lucky since these police officers are basically there to make a lot of money through bribes. There is a huge possibility that you will only get out of the situation by paying the tremendous bribe. Don’t lose your hope immediately as there are ways to get outside with paying a bit or paying no money at all.

First of all, be sure that you have a <strong>proper driving license and a valid and matching blue card </strong>in possession. Be sure that you comply with all the traffic rules, e.g. don’t speed, wear a helmet, use signals if turning, etc.

<em>If you know that you didn’t do anything wrong and you have all the proper documentation with you that enables you to drive legally in Vietnam, then don’t worry…</em>

<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pcojyqD4ziI" width="764" height="430" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>

At first, try to bargain. If it’s not going in the direction you’d like to, then simply ask for the ticket. The police will hesitate to give it to you at first as it takes time. They could earn much more money at that time, so they will usually let you go. If they write a ticket, don’t forget to write down all the information from their uniforms! Especially if you know that you didn’t do anything wrong.

Also, during the whole time <strong>don’t speak English</strong> (it’s helpful if you’re not a native English speaker). Or simply, use the accent and give them <em>"I don't understand!"</em> on everything they say! They will usually try to scare you down with tickets and talk.

If they see you’re confident and you know what are you doing with their info, they will just let you go. It always works!
<h2><b>Tips to Successfully Dealing with Vietnamese Police</b></h2>
<img class="size-full wp-image-1388 aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.dealing-with-traffic-police.jpg" alt="Vietnamese traffic police on streets" width="1024" height="761" />
<div class="image_description"><em>Don't panic and be calm when dealing with Vietnamese police. Everything is going to be fine!</em></div>
Getting pulled over by the police isn’t the thing you can control. You can always live with the fact that one day you might get pulled over. It’s nothing special, but having some tactics at hand will help you tremendously. You will definitely save you time and money in return. <em>Here are some tips we learned from our trip:</em>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Have two wallets. Hide the main wallet and have another wallet with <strong>200k - 500k on you</strong>. The best is to buy the gas or other things with the money from that wallet, so you break the bills in smaller bills. That will look more realistic than if you just have one bill note in your wallet. In case police pull you over, you just say it’s all the money you have, and police will usually accept it and leave you.</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Always bargain for the price since they will give you a huge price at the beginning, but they usually <strong>settle for around 200k VND</strong>.</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Always <strong>avoid tickets if you don’t have all the valid documents!</strong> That way, you’re 100% sure that you didn’t do anything wrong in the traffic.</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">When pulled over, <strong>speak broken English or even better, speak some other language</strong>. Also, you can act dumb if they speak English and they will probably leave you since they don’t have time to hustle with a foreigner.</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Wear tourist clothes, so even if they notice you, they won’t mind stopping you. Majority of people in the traffic are wearing long sleeves to protect their skin from the sun, dust, and dirt. We advise to put a sunscreen and just wear a T-shirt, and other tourist clothes and police will recognize you as a tourist.</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Just <strong>drive away if they wave their bat at you</strong>. If they start chasing you, simply stop and tell them you didn’t see or notice they are stopping you since in your country this is a different process. Act dumb again!</li>
</ul>
That’s it! Follow these tips and your dealings with police will mostly end up successfully!

<hr />

Believe us; it’s not a horror story to deal with traffic police. They won’t bother so much with foreign backpackers. If they pull you over though, just use the strategies from the article and you will be more than fine.

		<Categories><![CDATA[Vietnam>Travel Tips]]></Categories>
		<Content><![CDATA[Da Nang is a touristic city that underwent crazy developments during the last 10 years. It is a very attractive city for expats where you can see a vibrant community is growing each day. Many expats are getting work permits that enable them to live in Vietnam for an extended time without getting a new visa and go through a whole documentation process, but for some people, doing a visa run is still a harsh reality. Da Nang is located in central Vietnam where the country is very narrow and it reaches around 100 km in the width.

There are many remote border crossings around, but only Lao Bao is an international one where you can do a quick visa run to Laos. The whole process is pretty straightforward and everything is going like a charm since the border is dealing with many foreigners on a daily basis. The route to reach the border crossing from Da Nang is very scenic and historically important, so we’re going to share the process of getting your new Vietnamese visa along with the route and ways to reach Lao Bao border.

<em>Let’s start with the documentation and process of getting your new Vietnamese visa!</em>
<h2><b>Documents You Need Before Heading to Lao Bao</b></h2>
Before doing a visa run, be sure that you have all the documents for a new visa application. Gathering all documentation is very easy and it won’t take you much time or money, but be sure to double-check everything!

<strong><em>Documents you need:</em></strong>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Invitation letter</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Two passport size photos</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Passport</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Money for Laos visa</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Money for Vietnam visa</li>
</ul>
<em><strong>Basically, these 5 things on the list are everything you’ll need to have on you when heading to Lao Bao!</strong></em>

<strong>Details: <a href="https://www.givevolunteers.org/wp-content/uploads/laos_visa_information_1.10.17.pdf">Laos visa forms, fees and documentation!</a></strong>

<strong>Details: <a href="https://www.vietnam-immigration.org.vn/faqs/view/where-can-i-download-a-visa-application-form.html">Vietnam visa forms, fees and documentation!</a></strong>

It’s effortless to gather all the documents, but it’s recommended to start thinking on time when it comes to documentation since getting an invitation letter can take up to one week as you need to have an original letter with the stamp with you!

<h2><b>How to Get an Invitation Letter in Da Nang</b></h2>
An invitation letter is a sponsorship letter provided by a company. If you’re working for a company then you will most likely get the letter sponsored by your company, so you don’t need to worry about it. For others who’re not working with a Vietnamese company, you need to figure out how to get the invitation letter (sounds harsh, but in reality, it's a piece of cake!).

There are many companies that are offering invitation letter services, but the majority of them are very <strong>limited when it comes to the border options and it takes much time for the post to deliver the original letter to your address</strong>. We were having a hard time finding a reliable company in Da Nang that provides with the invitation letter for Lao Bao.

After a few days of looking and talking with expats, we found <a href="https://www.facebook.com/lynn.visaviet.1"><strong>Lynn from Da Nang</strong></a>! A lovely lady provides <strong>invitation letters specifically for Lao Bao</strong> and one more amazing thing about her service - she provides you with filled application forms to save your time on the border! The price of the letter is <strong>$25</strong>. She will deliver the original letter to your address and if you don’t have dollars, they accept VND by the exchange rate on the current day.
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b>Transportation Options From Da Nang to Lao Bao</b></h2>
There are few transportation options when it comes to reaching Lao Bao border which is always a perk when you’re living in a huge city. It really depends on your budget and time which option you’re going to pick, so we’re going to introduce you with all options.
<h3><b>Taking a Public Bus</b></h3>
<img class="size-full wp-image-1502 aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.37954999436_282780208b_k.jpg" alt="sleeper bus in vietnam" width="2048" height="1365" />
<div class="image_description"><em>An iconic red sleeper bus! If you're not driving inside, be careful of these furious buses in the traffic!</em></div>
Taking a public bus is the cheapest option, but also it will take most of your time. You need to go to Da Nang bus terminal and find Lao Bao counter. Be sure that you’re getting a direct ticket to Lao Bao as there won’t be any stops until Dong Ha. If you take a normal ticket, the bus will be crappy, overloaded and with hundreds of stops.

That kind of trip can last for a day! The bus drive will take <strong>about 6 hours (stops included)</strong> to reach Lao Bao international border.

<strong><a href="https://www.danangbus.com/services/sleeper-bus-booking/sleeper-bus-routes/from-danang-to-laos/danang-to-lao-bao-border/sleeper-bus-from-danang-to-laobao-border/">Check out all the details about the buses and schedule</a>.</strong>

Another option that gives you a bit more flexibility is getting the bus directly to Dong Ha and then hire a private shuttle to the border. It’s a bit more expensive, but it won’t break your bank, especially if you’re in a rush with a time.
<h3><b>Hiring a Private Car or Shuttle</b></h3>
<img class="size-full wp-image-1503 aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.4955048028_9d8e95fd9f_b.jpg" alt="private car in Vietnam" width="1024" height="680" />
<div class="image_description"><em>Getting to Lao Bao by car is a very flexible way, but it will cost you a lot. The best way is to have a group of people who are sharing </em>costs<em> of the car!</em></div>
The option to hire a car or shuttle from Da Nang is possible, but it can be a bit more expensive, especially if you don’t have a group of people going together. Visa van has the option, on certain dates, to organize a <strong>group tour to the border and back for $30 per person</strong>. It’s an amazing deal and you’re done with everything <strong>in 12 hours</strong>.

They also have a private driver, if you can’t go in their organized dates, but that service <strong>costs 2.5 million VND</strong>. It’s very expensive if you’re going alone, but if you’re going with few people, then it can be the best option for you when it comes to budget and time.

<strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/DaNangVisaVan/">Check Visa Van on Facebook!</a></strong>

<em><strong>Note: </strong>We're not affiliated with them and we’re not getting any compensation mentioning the company. We tried their services and we’re more than happy what they did for the low price. </em>

<em>Definitely a recommendation when it comes to doing a visa run from Da Nang!</em> Hiring a driver can be a bit costly, but you are totally flexible when it comes to timing since there are <strong>no stops and driver will usually take the fastest route to Lao Bao</strong>.
<h3><b>Driving Your Motorbike</b></h3>
<img class="size-full wp-image-1495 aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20181128_143828.jpg" alt="Honda Wave at Lao Bao" width="4160" height="3120" />
<div class="image_description"><em>Antonio's beloved Honda at the entrance of Lao Bao international border.</em></div>
Driving a motorbike can be a bit tricky, especially for people who’re still not comfortable with Vietnamese traffic. Antonio did his visa run driving the motorbike to Lao Bao. When driving there, you’re going to pass through amazing passes (Hai Van), driving around stunning nature, stumbling upon random waterfalls, experiencing a local life around Quang Tri province and having your costs under control.

The biggest concern when it comes to a driving motorbike is the safety of course and time consumed. For the budget, you’re in charge of it since you only need to spend on the fuel and maintenance of the motorbike. Everything else is up to you.

When it comes to time, you will probably need a whole day if you want to do a visa run in one day. Antonio took three days since he was exploring the province and the roads. Quang Tri is the most bombed province during the war and it has huge historical meaning, so driving and going around the sites can teach you a lot. Antonio was really unlucky as the weather was terrible, so he stayed in Dong Ha for a night and the next day he continued his trip to Lao Bao. Driving to Dong Ha took about 6 hours with few stops and rain during the whole trip. From Dong Ha to Lao Bao, expect to <strong>drive 2 - 3 hours of chilling drive</strong>.

The road there is amazing and the way provides you with crazy beautiful scenery!

<em>In the further text, we’re going to provide you with a detailed description of the route from Da Nang to Lao Bao and back!</em>
<h2><b>The Process of Getting a New Vietnamese Visa</b></h2>
<img class="wp-image-1494 size-full aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20181128_141141.jpg" alt="Lao Bao international border" width="4160" height="3120" />
<div class="image_description"><em>Entrance to Lao Bao border from the Vietnam side.</em></div>
Well, the process is pretty straightforward and easy since the immigration process many foreigners there, so the whole process is well-organized for Vietnamese standards. Also, some officers can speak a bit of English which makes the whole process much easier!

<em><strong>So, once you get to the border, the process is next:</strong></em>
<ol>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Go to Laos side first and there is a small house with an immigration officer who will check your documents and invitation letter. The guy will stamp you out of Vietnam. This is where you do a STAMP OUT OF VIETNAM.</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Go to the next house which is just a few steps left from the first one and get the application for Laos visa. Fill in the form first!</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Go to LAOS VISA ON ARRIVAL and provide the officer with the application form, $35 and the photo for the passport. Our advice is to have dollars with you since they will charge you on a very bad exchange rate if you’re paying in VND. Once you get a sticker and the stamp, you’re ready to go again to the Vietnamese side.</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Go to LAOS EXIT STAMP and give the passport to the officer. They will check your invitation letter for Vietnam before giving you a stamp.</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Go to the next officer who will provide you with the application form for Vietnamese visa. Once you’re done with filling the form, you just need to pay for your visa and the officer will put the sticker in your passport.</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Go to VIETNAM ENTRY STAMP (next to the officer who gives you Laos exit stamp) and give him the passport. The officer will give you all the stamps and you’re ready to go! Just be sure to check out all the stamps and see if everything is matching.</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Pick up your motorbike in front of the immigration office and you will need to present your passport to another immigration officer outside. You’re ready to go!</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Congratulations! You’ve just got a new Vietnamese visa!</li>
</ol>
Yeah, that’s the whole process once you get to Lao Bao border. Believe us it’s very straightforward, but it can take a bit of time since the border is usually busy.

It took <strong>about 1 hour for the whole process</strong> when Antonio was going. That time, it wasn’t so busy, but there were many locals getting in and out of the country.

<em>Plan your time accordingly and good luck!</em>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b>Traveling from Da Nang to Lao Bao By Motorbike</b></h2>

In this section, we’re going to provide you with details about the route from Da Nang to Lao Bao. Please have in mind it was raining heavily when Antonio did a visa run, so he avoided the coastal drive. Probably the whole route would be more scenic if he added a bit of coastal ride, but anyway, the route he took was not so busy at that time, and it provided some spectacular views that add up to an overall driving experience.

In this part, we’re going to separate the whole journey into few sections, so we can give you more information and visual content on each section of the journey. Also, it can give you a more organized outlook of the journey so you can decide which parts or sections you’d like to take if you decide to do a visa run by motorbike.
<h3><b>Passing Hai Van</b></h3>
<img class="size-full wp-image-1504 aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.Da-Nang-74.jpg" alt="Overlooking Hai Van Pass" width="4608" height="3456" />
<div class="image_description"><em>Enjoying the view at the top of Hai Van pass.</em></div>
Depending on your starting location, the route may differ a bit. Anyway, you need to complete Hai Van Pass in order to get to Lao Bao. There is another route that heads directly to the west from Da Nang, but it’s a very long one and it doesn’t make much sense to take it if you’re lacking the time. People who’re starting the journey either from Hoi An or Da Nang should take the <strong>coastal road named Nguyen Tat Thanh</strong> which will give you stunning views over Da Nang bay and will show you how local fishermen lives. Once you hit that road, on your right you will see stunning Hai Van mountain overlooking the whole city.

You just follow the road and at the end of the road, there is 90-degree turn left that will connect you to infamous QL1. At that point, QL1 is usually busy since trucks and buses are getting outside the city and when you combine that with the busy outskirts of Da Nang, you get a very tricky situation to drive in. Be extra careful there! Just follow the road and you will get to the point where you’ll slowly climb to Hai Van.

Every kilometer will give you better and better views over the city.

<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z8-B-b-2Cr8&amp;" width="764" height="430" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>

The pass is always busy and the curvy road makes it very dangerous since there are many buses, trucks, and cars who’re overtaking, so don’t drive recklessly and you will be fine. Once you reach the top of Hai Van Pass, you can chill a bit while enjoying stunning looks over Da Nang city. That’s the first section of the journey and you roughly cover about 30 kilometers reaching the top of Hai Van Pass.

Lao Bao border is about <strong>260 kilometers away from Da Nang</strong>, so there is a lot more to cover!
<h3><b>Lang Co and Detouring Hue</b></h3>
<img class="size-full wp-image-1505 aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_1492-1.jpg" alt="Road detouring Hue" width="4608" height="3456" />
<div class="image_description"><em>Once you pass Hai Van mountain, there is an infamous QL1 with stunning views of Bach Ma mountains.</em></div>
When you reach the top of Hai Van Pass and starting to descend the mountain, you will be presented with stunning views, river streams, waterfalls, and stunning infinite ocean view. Just drive slowly as the road conditions aren’t the best and usually the road is a bit slippery, even on the sunny days since there is some oil, mud, and sand on the road.

When you reach the bottom of the mountain you will get to the small fishermen town called Lang Co. You will recognize it by a small river and a huge bridge circling around the river. After you pass the bridge, you’ll get in front of the Hai Van tunnel entrance. Be careful driving around there since it’s <strong>very busy with trucks and buses</strong> that usually don’t pay much attention to motorbike drivers.

Stay on QL1 and just drive carefully since you’re going to drive on that road for a long time now. The road conditions are relatively good, but the traffic is usually busy since this road connects Hue and Da Nang. This section is a bit boring since it’s just a straight road without not so much to see.

In the beginning, there is a huge lake and the coastal drive with the smell of pine trees in the air, but afterward, it’s just a highway passing through small towns and villages on the way.
<div class="image_description"><em>Detour around Hue offers few amazing spots and wild rivers!</em></div>
At one point, you should turn right and just continue to follow QL1. If you continue to drive straight, you will end up in Hue, which isn’t a mistake, but you probably want to avoid the busy city and take a detour instead. Antonio just stayed on QL1 and did a detour around Hue. The road is very dangerous since it’s narrow and trucks are the main vehicles in the traffic.

There are few gas stations and parking lots on the way, and nothing more. Just stick to QL1 and you will soon reach the town in front of Hue. After that, you’re just going to stick to QL1 till you reach Dong Ha. There are not many things to see in this section, but there are few towns where you can rest and refuel your energy. Don’t forget to try their iconic Bun Bo Hue!
<h3><b>Dong Ha to Lao Bao</b></h3>
<img class="size-full wp-image-1506 aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20181128_155301.jpg" alt="Dong Ha to Lao Bao" width="4160" height="3120" />
<div class="image_description"><em>The way from Dong Ha to Lao Bao is filled with the views like this one!</em></div>
Once you reach Dong Ha, it’s time to refuel yourself with amazing food and good coffee. The city itself isn’t much interesting, but the vibe and people there are amazing! There are a few amazing coffee places where you can chill a bit and also, the food around the center is delicious and relatively cheap, even compared to Da Nang. It was very strange when Antonio mentioned he had trouble finding a Banh Mi around Dong Ha!

In the city, there are few amazing homestays if you decide to stay there for a night and continue your trip the next day. Antonio stayed two nights at Hoa Phuong Guesthouse. The guest house is run by the family and they are very friendly and hospitable. They can cook a few meals from the menu, but the value isn’t the best for the price you pay. Also, the room was cozy and very clean and for the price of about <strong>130k per night</strong>, it was definitely a good deal!

The most pleasurable driving experience starts once you hit the road from Dong Ha in the direction to Lao Bao. The whole route is <strong>about 70 kilometers</strong> and if you’re starting from Dong Ha, you don’t need to rush and you can just take your time to explore the beauty of Quang Tri province. Along the road, you will stumble upon many historic places from the war since this part of the province was the most bombed and also the bloodiest battles were held there.

That was the northernmost province of South Vietnam at that time. <em><strong>The</strong> <strong>road conditions are amazing since there are not many holes or construction works and also traffic isn’t heavy</strong></em>.

When you combine these conditions of the road with stunning curvy road surrounded by valleys and mountain ranges in the distance, wild river streams, waterfalls, and crazy beautiful views, you get the perfect driving experience!

<em>There are few pictures showing the memorable parts of the route to Lao Bao and also the videos so you can see the beauty yourself:</em> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1510" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20181128_162325.jpg" alt="" width="4160" height="3120" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1511" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20181128_123853.jpg" alt="" width="4160" height="3120" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1512" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20181128_150442.jpg" alt="" width="4160" height="3120" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1513" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20181128_125214.jpg" alt="" width="4160" height="3120" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1514" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20181128_115305.jpg" alt="" width="4160" height="3120" /> https://youtu.be/VLiQiWW5yOw

<h2><strong>Costs of Doing a Visa Run to Lao Bao by Motorbike</strong></h2>
We recommend you driving your own motorbike if you're not having a time limit and you're flexible with your budget. Antonio wanted to drive around the province for at least week to explore historical places, but unfortunately, the rain didn't stop pouring for a week, so he decided to come back to Da Nang after three days on the road.

<em><strong>Here's the breakdown of the cost he had by categories:</strong></em>

<img class="wp-image-1490 size-full aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.budgdt-lao-bao.jpg" alt="Budget for Lao Bao visa run" width="1487" height="661" />
<div class="image_description"><em>Here's the whole breakdown of costs of visa run to Lao Bao and back.</em></div>
As you can see, the who trip costed <strong>roughly 2,920,000 VND</strong>. Antonio was three days on the road and staying two days at the guest house. The province is very cheap when it comes to food (similar prices as the prices in local places around Da Nang), but since the tourism isn't a huge economic driver there, the accommodation options are scarce. It means there are hostels which gives you only guest houses as the option. Guest houses are amazing accommodation, don't get us wrong, but it can hit your wallet, especially if you're traveling alone!

We're always doing comprehensive research when it comes to booking accommodation, so this time, Antonio took the best value room. He chose Hoa Phuong Guest House because of a good price combined with amazing reviews and highest ratings in the city.
<h2><b>Final Words</b></h2>
Doing a visa run is the reality for the majority of travelers who wants to stay for a bit longer in Vietnam. It’s not the most convenient way to extend your visa, but it is cheap and usually gives you an amazing experience. We recommend you going to Lao Bao by your own motorbike since you get complete freedom. If you’re lacking the time, motorbike drive isn’t advisable since the<strong> whole round-trip is 550 kilometers long</strong> and it’s almost impossible to finish it in one day. If you’re lucky and have a few days to do a visa run, then definitely take the bike.

The accommodation, food and all other things are relatively cheap in the countryside, the roads combined with stunning views give you an unforgettable experience. The whole visa process is pretty straightforward since there are many travelers doing a visa run on a daily basis. Antonio was <strong>3 days on the road</strong> while doing the visa run and spent<strong> around 3 million VND</strong> on the whole visa run (process + logistics).

		<Excerpt>Your motorbike trip around Vietnam is over and now you’re looking to sell your beloved motorbike? Here’s the complete guide on selling a motorbike in Vietnam without losing loads of cash.

		<Content><![CDATA[Unfortunately, your amazing motorbike trip around Vietnam is almost over and you’re leaving the country in a few days. Wait! You still have a motorbike and you need to figure out what to do with the bike and how to get the most of your invested money back! Many people claim they get the same or even more money they paid for the bike once they sell it.

<strong><em> How true is that statement? How can you sell your bike fast and get the most of the money back?</em></strong>

If you don’t have much time left in Vietnam, but still have a bike, then this guide is definitely for you!

We sold two bikes and tried two completely different strategies while selling, so we’re going to show you the results and how you can apply your marketing skills when it comes to selling the bike.
<h2><b>Where to Sell Your Motorbike</b></h2>
<img class="size-full wp-image-1523 aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20180821_113837.jpg" alt="Where to sell motorbike in Vietnam?" width="4160" height="3120" />
<div class="image_description"><em>Selling in huge cities like Saigon, Da Nang or Hanoi was never a huge hustle since the market is enormously big!</em></div>
So the first question that arises is what is the best place to sell your motorbike. As most people usually start their trips from Saigon or Hanoi, it would be the ideal place to sell your bike. The market in both cities is enormously huge and you won’t have much hustle when finding the buyer for your beloved bike. <strong><em>The biggest hustle you'll have is to get the asked price for your bike!</em></strong>
<blockquote>
<h3><strong><em>We bought our bikes in Hanoi and sold two of them in Saigon. David started to do marketing for his Atilla when we were in Mui Ne (5 days before selling) and Antonio sold it in few hours without any prior marketing!</em></strong></h3>
</blockquote>
<strong><em>We tried different platforms when we were posting our bike ad, so we found out these few the most effective:</em></strong>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/882003845187734/">Vietnam Backpackers Travel &amp; Sales</a></strong> - the huge facebook group with more than <strong>50k travelers</strong> who’re actively selling and buying used motorbikes. Also, you can find motorbike shops doing the marketing there which can help you in selling your bike fast. Leave it as the last option if you really don't have much time left since they will offer funny prices.</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://vietnam.craigslist.org/d/motorcycles-scooters/search/mca?lang=en&amp;cc=us"><strong>Craigslist</strong></a> - the best for travelers who don’t have much time left since many buyers are looking to buy cheap bikes, do some adjustments, and sell it for a higher price. It’s the place for people who just want to get rid of their bikes. Don’t expect to get even close to the invested money back!</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Walking around expat and tourist areas</strong> - in these areas, there are many hostels and shops that want to buy your motorbike. Walk-in and ask people at the reception if they’d like to see your bike. That works like a charm, but the price you get can be far from the ideal.</li>
</ul>
Alright, now you have more options when it comes to selling your bike. Ideally, if you have enough time, you can try all of them and go for the best offering price.

<strong>Extra help: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/search/groups/?q=motorbike%20in%20vietnam&amp;epa=SERP_TAB">Facebook groups for selling/buying used motorbikes in Vietnam</a></strong>

<em><strong>If you’re really scarce on time, then we recommend using Facebook groups for the best offer!</strong> </em>
<h2><b>A Step-By-Step Guide to Get the Best Price for Your Motorbike</b></h2>
<img class="size-full wp-image-1524 aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20180725_142251.jpg" alt="Honda Win and Wave side by side" width="4160" height="3120" />
<div class="image_description"><em>Selling bike, with a bit of creativity and enough time isn't a struggle in Vietnam.</em></div>
We can’t say it’s the best guide ever and we can’t guarantee you’ll get the best money following it, but it may help you! That’s the exact same process we were doing while selling the bikes and we were very lucky and happy with the deal taking in the account that we <strong>sold our bikes just an hour before David and Lovel had a flight</strong>.
<ol>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Start posting on Facebook a <strong>few days before you arrive at the final destination</strong> since it will give you more exposure and time to negotiate with people. That way you won’t have time pressure and you don’t need to worry about putting the price down. It would be awesome if you have two days in the final destination just for selling the bike!</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">When posting on Facebook, don’t hesitate to <strong>write a witty and detailed post with pictures and videos of your bike and journey</strong>. We took many photos and videos around Vietnam and in our postings, we included many of them. Also, our advice is to talk about the maintenance, breakdowns, new parts, the current condition of the bike and extras you have on the bike. Be honest about the breakdowns, new parts and include costs!</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">If you don’t have, <strong>invest in a good quality raincoat, luggage rack, a few extra bungees, a bike lock, a good helmet, and phone holder</strong>. These things won’t cost you a lot, but it can add up to the value of your bike since travelers need these things to conveniently travel around the country.</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Wash and clean the bike! You can find a bike washer everywhere! Just look for the sign that says “<em>Rua Xe</em>”.</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Change the oil, tighten the brakes and chain and fill the bike with the gas.</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">As for <strong>at least 30% higher price</strong> than your lowest accepting price (buying price), so there is still room for negotiation.</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Offer free driving lessons, route and experience exchange. It goes great with free beers!</li>
</ol>
<em><strong>That’s basically it!</strong></em> Just be honest, witty and go into details! People love it and the quality of the posting will definitely catch their attention.

Also, they will notice that you’d take good care of your bike which means the condition of the engine is probably good (the most important thing!).
<h2><b>Other Handy Tips for Selling Your Bike Fast While Getting Your Money Back</b></h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3349" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_0870.jpg" alt="SYM Atilla on the road" width="4608" height="3456" /> With the guide above, you should be able to sell your bike pretty fast at a good price. Still, there are few more tips that go handy and that can help you a lot! If you’re following backpackers groups and market, you will notice that the most bikes that are being bought or sold are <strong>Honda Wins or Waves</strong>.

There are many fake Honda bikes on the market, but you will instantly see it by different brand name on the engine. Nevertheless, these bikes are easy to sell. Other slightly popular bikes among travelers are <strong>SYM and Yamaha</strong>. With these brands, you might have trouble finding the buyer since parts and qualified mechanics are a bit harder to find which means the prices of repairs are bigger. It’s not an attractive fact for budget travelers looking for an adventure of their lifetime.
<blockquote>
<h3><strong><em>David had SYM Atilla, a fully automatic motorbike and he managed to sell it for $180 in Saigon. He lost $20 on the sale, but it was a good deal since he had only a few hours before his flight.</em> </strong></h3>
</blockquote>
Antonio sold his Sufat Win for $110 which was pretty good since he has got the<strong> <a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/motorbike-in-vietnam">bike for free as a gift in Hanoi</a></strong>. Another tip is to not invest so much money in the motorbike when you’re buying since it will be hard to get the same price. Of course, these bikes will provide you with a better experience on the road, but in the end, you want to sell it for almost the same price you bought it, right?

Lovel bought a <strong>real Honda Wave for $350 in Hanoi</strong> and got so many offers that weren’t higher than $250. To sell these bikes, expect to stay at least three days in the final destination actively looking for a good sale. Also, when buying a bike from the shops, many of them have a deal to buy your bike back in Saigon or Hanoi.

They will usually give you <strong>70 to 80% of the buying price</strong>, but at least you have a sure thing. You can also put it into consideration.

<em><strong>Note:</strong> Shops claim to give you that price on the bike, but we haven't tried it, so we don't know for sure how reliable it is</em>!

<hr />

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3351" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.Phong-Nha-69.jpg" alt="Somewhere in Phong Nha" width="4608" height="3456" /> So now you have an actionable guide when selling the motorbike in Vietnam. Don’t worry, it won’t be much of the hustle to sell your bike since the demand is huge in both cities. The usual advice from the traveler is to <strong><a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/buy-motorbike-in-vietnam">buy a bike in Hanoi</a></strong> and sell it in Saigon since the price you will get in Saigon will be better. The opposite is for buying the bike of course.

We wish you all the luck to sell your bike and get the best money, so you can continue your trip without worrying about the money.
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Please let us know how did you sell your bikes and what was the difference between buying and selling price! </strong></em></h3>]]></Content>

Before coming to Vietnam, I’ve never had any experience working with kids except playing some games with my cousins. That’s all! After some research, I just decided to fly to Vietnam and start <a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/starlight-english-center-vietnam">volunteering as an English teacher</a> in the countryside to get teaching experience. I didn’t have any idea what to expect and I was totally opened and ready for anything.

I knew I could handle anything! My first impression of teaching was me <strong>coming to a small classroom with 20 or more kids inside</strong>. The teacher told me to play games with the kids and I didn’t have any idea what to do.

I figured it out and spot and started to play <em>‘Simon says’</em>. Kids enjoyed and the rest is history. I was concerned about how everything will look like since I didn’t feel comfortable with kids at the beginning, but after a few days of teaching, I started to love the project and the kids.

<strong><em>You’ll have to deal with many things as a teacher in Vietnam:</em></strong>
<h3><b>Language Barrier</b></h3>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3380" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.language-barrier.jpg" alt="Language barrier is real in Vietnam" width="962" height="620" /> The language barrier is real and you will notice it from the first moment of arriving. Even the <strong>teachers can’t talk English fluently</strong> and wait for it - these teachers usually teach in primary and high schools! You will definitely have a lot of struggle communicating with teachers and kids, but after a while, you will get used to each other and start to understand each other even if there is a barrier in the language.

<em>Just be patient and try your best to explain everything in the simplest way possible!</em>
<h3><b>Disorganization in the Schools</b></h3>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3382" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.school-kids.jpg" alt="School kid" width="932" height="615" /> If you’re used that all stuff should be organized, please don’t expect that in Vietnam. Really, the business in the school is one of the most disorganized things I’ve ever experienced in my life. It seems like almost no one knows their job and roles and everything is figured out on the spot. I mean, I like how people are flexible and how they can figure out things on the spot, but when you’re teaching, you want everything planned since it doesn’t only affect you, but also the students you’re teaching.
<blockquote><strong><em>I experienced people calling me on my off day, a few minutes before class to come to the school to teach. I didn’t have any prior preparation and I just woke up. It’s going to happen often if you let the management do that.</em></strong></blockquote>
<strong><em>Simply say no and explain to them the reasons.</em></strong> Also, many times there is no organized teaching or lesson plan, so sometimes you’re going to figure out everything on the spot which isn’t the most effective way.

Many schools won’t have proper materials which means you need to figure out the materials and ways to deliver the lesson to the students by yourself. If you can’t live with disorganization, then you will definitely have a lot of struggle adapting to the Vietnamese way of doing the business. And yeah... If the people in Vietnam tell you the starting time of the class or event, <strong>be ready to wait at least 10 minutes since they are very bad at timing and almost always late! </strong>
<h3><b>Class Size</b></h3>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pcX1EitiLOw" width="764" height="430" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>

It hugely depends on the type of school you’re teaching in. For instance, I was teaching in private centers where the number of students doesn’t exceed <strong>15 students</strong>. I was also teaching in public schools a few times where the <strong>classes have more than 40 students</strong>. The technique and <strong>approach to teaching really depend on the classroom size</strong> and it’s very important to know the number of students in the class before preparing for the lesson.

Your voice will have many struggles, even with small classes since Vietnamese students can be very active and noisy from time to time. I don’t need to tell you anything if you’re going to work with the kids - prepare yourself physically and mentally. You might have a question of controlling such huge classes with a big language barrier.

Well, don’t worry, many times you will have a struggle with that, but the good thing is that you will <strong>most likely have a teacher assistant who is Vietnamese and can help you in controlling kids. </strong> TA’s are of huge help! I had a few classes with 3 years old kids without an assistant and it was impossible to do anything except dancing, singing, and making a mess in the classroom.
<h3><b>Cultural Differences</b></h3>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3377" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.culture-difference.jpg" alt="Eating street food" width="1139" height="733" /> Depending on the place you’re coming from, the <a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/culture-shocks-in-vietnam">cultural differences in Vietnam</a> will probably be noticeable, especially in the way the educational system is working. For instance, Vietnamese schooling system is based on an <strong>outdated teaching method called memorization</strong>. Basically, from the first moment you arrive at school, you will see how the try kids to memorize the words.

They will successfully do that and after the class, they will be able to pass the test. <em>But...What happens a few days after the class?</em> You guess it. The kids don’t have any idea what you were teaching them!
<blockquote><em><strong>Memorization really doesn’t work long-term and I had so much struggle with it since I always try to be very creative while teaching. Many Vietnamese teachers and parents didn’t like it, so they ‘forced’ their old school teaching model.</strong> </em></blockquote>
Also, <strong>hitting kids is allowed in Vietnam</strong>. I was very shocked when the old teacher hit the kids’ heads with a wooden stick. It was pretty hard and loud hit and I was literally shocked. Many foreign teachers shared similar experiences and it’s accepted in Vietnam. Many Vietnamese teachers started to talk about it and it seems like there is a shift so these topics became sensitive around.

When we’re talking about the kids with special needs, they are seen as equal to the other kids, so you will have these kids in the same class with other kids. It’s very pointless since the kids with special needs are being taught at the same pace as other kids and you can notice they don’t get much from the lesson.

There should be a specially tailored program for these kids that will enable them to learn at their own pace. Anyway, teaching in Vietnam is an amazing experience that teaches you so many things, especially how to be patient. There were a lot of downs and negative experiences, but positives outweigh the negatives hard time.
<h2><b>Requirements to Become an English Teacher in Vietnam </b></h2>
<img class="wp-image-3375 size-full aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.kristina-last-class.jpg" alt="Teaching in the private English center" width="960" height="720" />
<div class="image_description"><em>The entry barrier in teaching is very low, so it's relatively easy to become a teacher. It's a </em>very discussable<em> topic!</em></div>
<em>Before starting with your new career, there are some requirements to become an English teacher:</em>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Bachelor’s degree</strong>: It doesn’t matter the field of your degree. It’s a huge plus if you have a degree in the education field, but not a requirement. Be sure to have a bachelor of any field since getting a work permit requires a degree. It is a great way to filter only the highly educated people from the rest.</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Clean criminal record</strong>: Before applying for a work permit or any job in Vietnam, you’re required to provide a clean criminal record from your home country. While it is possible to land a job with a criminal record, it definitely limits your options.</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Teaching certificate (TEFL/TESOL/CELTA)</strong>: It’s not a requirement, but it gives you so many options. Getting one will teach you how to deal with students and how to successfully deliver the lesson. There are many online courses you can take, but be sure that the course you’re taking is worldwide recognized. Antonio took one from <a href="https://internationalopenacademy.com/">International Open Academy</a> for $20 on a discount. It's not recognized worldwide, but he didn't have any problems finding a job with that certificate.</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Teaching experience</strong>: The prior experience will definitely help since many schools require the demo lesson before the interview to see your teaching skills. That’s the point where your previous experience can help! Don’t worry if you don’t have any prior experience since many schools don’t care that much. Also, you can start with a volunteering project first to gather some experience, and then you can move to the paid project.</li>
</ul>
<h2><b>How Hard is to Find a Teaching Job? </b></h2>
<img class="wp-image-3371 size-full aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.44098191_2116427708610260_8395760580836720640_n.jpg" alt="Teaching adults in Da Nang" width="960" height="720" />
<div class="image_description"><em>Teaching kids is fun but requires a lot of patience. Teaching adults is a totally new level that gives you countless friendships and a great time.</em></div>
I’m sad to say that Vietnam is a <strong>very racist country when it comes to teaching</strong>. If you’re a young white person from a native country without any experience and knowledge about what you’re doing, you’re the perfect candidate. I met a guy who has a Ph.D., over 5 years of experience in teaching, but he is from India. He couldn’t land a job and barely got a volunteering gig in Vietnam. So many people talk about this issue, so for many, Vietnam is not so attractive because of it. When I first came to Vietnam, I started to volunteer and I’ve got some experience while teaching kids.

Then I started to travel around Vietnam without having a teaching career in the mind. When I was done with the trip I needed to figure out how to get the money that will enable me to stay here for a long time and make some savings on the way.

<strong>Traveling Vietnam: </strong><a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/vietnam-on-a-budget">Check out the budget breakdown for a motorbike trip in Vietnam!</a>

The teaching market is huge and demand is still bigger than the supply which means getting the job as a non-native speaker is very possible. I started to apply to many job opportunities around the Facebook groups and got many offers, but didn’t accept any since the majority of the jobs is in Hanoi or Saigon. I wanted to work in Da Nang, but there weren’t many jobs available.

<em><strong>When I’ve come to Da Nang I simply started to drive around with my CV and going to different schools talking with the management. It landed me a few interviews and some teaching hours. </strong></em> Right now, I’m working for a small center that I found on the Facebook group.

There are many job opportunities in Da Nang, but the competition is huge since many centers are <strong>strictly looking for native speakers with qualifications and experience. </strong>

I’m lucky since I have experience and qualification and my English is very fluent. Also, there is one thing that will separate you from other candidates -<strong><em> being passionate to teach!</em></strong>

If you’re looking for jobs in Hanoi or Saigon, then you shouldn’t experience any problems! Simply check out these Facebook groups and connect with the schools that are looking for teachers.

<em><strong>Note:</strong></em> <em>It’s normal to be asked for a free demo lesson and interview afterward.</em>
<h2><b>How Much Money Does an English Teacher Make in Vietnam?</b></h2>
<img class="wp-image-3372 size-full aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.getting-paid-in-vietnam.jpg" alt="Getting paid in Vietnam" width="1148" height="775" />
<div class="image_description"><em>Teacher's salaries are very good compared to Vietnamese average salary. The hourly rate starts at $15 and it can reach up to $30 for international schools.</em></div>
It really depends on your qualifications, experience, type of school, and the location.

From my experience, the usual<strong> hourly rate starts at $15 and can even go up to $30.</strong> We’re talking about the rate after tax! Usually, you’ll get the probation period for the first month and the salary will be a bit lower, but once you get the contract, you can expect a higher salary.

<strong>More information: </strong><a href="https://travelingteacher.net/">How to become a certified English teacher in Vietnam!</a>

The most usual way how schools pay the teachers are by the bank accounts. Once you get a work permit, you’re able to open a Vietnamese bank account where the schools deposit your salary. Many job opportunities<strong> offer 80 - 100 teaching hours per month and free accommodation</strong>.

You do the math how much money you can earn and save per month.
<h2><b>Types of English Schools in Vietnam</b></h2>
<img class="wp-image-3374 size-full aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.494185263_801759696a_b.jpg" alt="Kids going from the school" width="1024" height="685" />
<div class="image_description"><em>There are few types of schools, but most likely, you're going to teach in a privately-owned English center.</em></div>
<em>Every school type will provide you with a different overall experience. English teachers usually teach at:</em>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Language centers</strong>: In the last few years, English centers started to pop up like mushrooms after the rain. In the big cities, it’s not unusual to see a few centers in the same street, even next to each other. Many of these centers are filled with kids from primary and secondary schools. I’m teaching at private English centers and usually, you’ll get 20 hours per week in the afternoon hours; when kids finish with their classes at school. I prefer language centers since the classes are smaller, you have a teacher assistant and there is some existing organization. Not to forget, the length of the classes is usually 1.5 hours.</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Public schools</strong>: I was teaching a few times in public schools since the kids from the center are mainly from public schools and centers have cooperation with these schools. The classroom is bigger and you’ll usually need to handle about 30 students. The pay is better and the classes are up to 30 minutes.</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>International schools</strong>: If you’re a very qualified teacher, then this type of school is the way to go! These are schools that follow a specially created curriculum. For instance, some schools follow the same curriculum as in England, so these are providing more benefits for the people enrolling to the classes. The payment is very attractive, but it requires a lot of experience in planning and delivering the lessons. Also, you have to be a native English speaker to land a job in these.</li>
</ul>
<h2><b>What About Visa and Work Permit for Teaching Legally?</b></h2>
<img class="wp-image-3373 aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.2502642043_56a7df25f3_b.jpg" alt="Visa and work permit for Vietnam" width="806" height="604" />
<div class="image_description"><em>Be sure to have all proper documentation sorted out before starting out your new teaching job.</em></div>
Unfortunately, you’ll need to do a <strong>quite lot of documentation in order to become a legal English teacher in Vietnam</strong>. There are many cases where teachers are working on tourist or business visas, but please note it’s illegal and you can get deported from the country if you get caught. The immigration officers sometimes pop up at centers or schools to check out the situation and there are many stories of teachers who got deported because working on a wrong visa or without proper documents. Many schools will tell you it’s fine to teach without the contract or on a tourist visa, but don’t believe that!

If you don’t have a contract and work permit with a school, then you’re technically an illegal teacher who is risking a deport stamp in your passport. Be smart and find a school that will support you in the process of obtaining a work permit. Getting a work permit can be a costly and long process, but it’s necessary if you want to stay for a long time in Vietnam.

The schools will usually give you a probation month or two while helping you with getting a work permit, so you can earn money and work while waiting for the permit to be processed.

<em><strong>There are many documents you need to obtain in order to get a work permit:</strong></em>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">A working contract from your school</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">A legalized copy of your degree</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">A legalized copy of your teaching certificate</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">A criminal background check from your home country</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">A health check is done in a Vietnamese hospital</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">A scan of your passport and valid visa</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">4 passport-sized photos</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Business visa sponsored by your school</li>
</ul>
Once you have all the documents in your pocket, you’re ready for the process of getting a work permit.

<em>Congratulations! After getting your work permit, you officially became an English teacher in Vietnam!</em>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b>Frequently Asked Questions </b></h2>
We did research on the topic and come up with the answers to the most common questions people ask when thinking about coming to Vietnam to teach English. We already answered many questions through the article, but this is a huge step for many people, so it’s never enough information.
<h3><em><b>How much teachers can make in Vietnam?</b></em></h3>
The usual <strong>hourly rates start at $15 and can reach up to $30</strong>. It hugely depends on the type of school and the location. For instance, I am currently living and teaching in Da Nang where the costs are bit lower and the competition is huge, so the average hourly rate is around $18. Expect to work around <strong>80 hours for a full-time position and 50 for half-time</strong>. Many schools will provide their teachers with free accommodation, which means you’ll save a lot of money for your future travels.
<h3><em><b>Do you need a degree to teach in Vietnam?</b></em></h3>
Shortly, yes! You need at least a bachelor’s degree to legally teach in Vietnam. Many people don’t have any degree and they teach, but most likely on the wrong visa which makes them vulnerable from immigration. In order to get a work permit in Vietnam, you must have at least a bachelor’s diploma.
<h3><b><em>Can you teach without a teaching certificate?</em> </b></h3>
Yes, but it limits your opportunities. Many schools will require you to get a teaching certificate before starting, but also, they will accept candidates without one. Every school will require you to take a course once you start working with them if you already don’t have one. There are many places where you can obtain a teaching certificate. Sometimes it’s very confusing, so we advise you to always <strong>get an internationally recognized certificate</strong>.
<h3><em><b>What are the best cities to work in Vietnam?</b></em></h3>
Definitely major cities in Vietnam - Saigon, Da Nang, Hanoi. There are many job opportunities and different school types. For experienced and qualified teachers there are many amazing positions in the huge cities. Also, the quality of life is not comparable to smaller cities. The salaries are more attractive, but also the cost of living is higher, so it’s up to you to make the decision.

For non-natives, it’s easier to get a job in smaller cities or countryside since the competition is very weak or even non-existent. The biggest downside of smaller cities is not enough things to do. I was living in the countryside and teaching for 4 months and after a few months the project became very boring and everything seemed like a routine, so I needed to move on.
<h3><em><b>Where to find job opportunities?</b></em></h3>
The best and easiest way to find your next teaching project is by checking the major Facebook groups.

<strong><em>Here are some groups:</em></strong>
<ul>
 	<li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/224249958335462/">Teaching jobs in Da Nang</a></li>
 	<li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/916145635087307/">Teaching jobs in Vietnam</a></li>
 	<li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/1517310348497729/">Hanoi English teaching jobs</a></li>
 	<li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/123103348331362/">Teaching jobs in Saigon</a></li>
</ul>
Simply put a few pictures of yourself teaching, write a bit about yourself and post it to the groups. Soon, you will get many requests and contacts from school owners or recruiters.

<em><strong>Have prepared CV, passport scan, and teaching certificate (optional).</strong> </em>
<h3><em><b>How to get teaching experience before applying for a teaching position?</b></em></h3>
The best advice I can give you when it comes to getting experience as an English teacher is by volunteering first. I started to volunteer as a teacher in the countryside to get the feeling of teaching. I didn’t have any idea how it will look like, but I was very curious about it and also it was a huge challenge to me.

I gave it a try! After a while, I started to really enjoy teaching kids and I decided I can take a job and teach for a while in Vietnam.
<h3><em><b>How hard is for a non-native speaker to get a teaching job?</b></em></h3>
It really depends on many factors. As we already mentioned, Vietnam is a bit racists country, but when it comes to teaching then you will really experience racism. I met many non-natives with an almost native level of teaching getting struggle with finding their job as they were from Asia, specifically from the Philippines or Singapore.

After observing and talking with many teachers, I would say that if you’re a good-looking white person with a fluent level of English, you can score a job in Vietnam. It will be a bit tougher in major cities since the competition is huge and there are many native speakers, but you can give it a try! In smaller cities or countryside you can definitely score a good job!

<hr />

<h2><b>Final Words</b></h2>

<div class="image_description"><em>Teaching English in Vietnam is an amazing experience where you'll learn so much from the people and students. Just be patient and open-minded!</em></div>
Teaching English in Vietnam is an amazing way to get exposed to totally new experiences and learn many things about yourself and culture. Also, the money is very good when you take into the account that you're living in Vietnam. There are not many requirements to score your new English teaching job, but there are definitely many tricky situations and scams on the market.

Always be careful when thinking about getting the new teaching job and don't agree on working without a work permit as a teacher! You'll most likely have an experience of your life while helping people to improve their life circumstances!

		<Content><![CDATA[So you were thinking of visiting Vietnam for a long time and you finally decided to explore this stunning country? There’s one hassle before going there - <strong>a visa process and administration</strong>. <em>Yeah, we know, it sounds very boring, but you can’t avoid it!</em> Luckily for us, travelers, entering Vietnam is a very easy and straightforward process as they have an e-visa program that works quite well for travelers all over the world. It's good to know that the process itself is very cheap and it won’t take you much time to get the proper supporting papers for your visa.
<div class="single_post_info_box"><i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle fa-2x"></i> We hold a Croatian passport which is ranked as number 10 passport in the world, so it’s very easy for us to get a Vietnam visa. Every country has almost the same process, but it’s advisable to check the process for your country before going to Vietnam.</div>
<em>In this article, we’re going to provide you with all the information on getting a Vietnam tourist visa before flying to the country, extending, renewing, and doing an infamous visa run!</em>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><b>Types of Visa You Can Get For Vietnam</b></h2>
Depending on the purpose of your trip, there are few options when it comes to visas. Usually, people get a tourist visa and the information in this article is mainly focused on a tourist visa.  What if you plan to work in Vietnam? You definitely need to <strong>grant a business visa and obtain a work permit</strong>. For travelers who’re traveling to another country through Vietnam, the best way to spend some quality time in the country is by getting a transit visa.

<em>We’re going to cover all types of visa you can get and the options to extend your time in the country if you really like your time here!</em>
<h2><b>A Few Things About Vietnam Tourist Visa</b></h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3527" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.croatian-passport.jpg" alt="Croatian passport" width="708" height="528" /> <em>A tourist visa is the most issued visa in Vietnam and the number of visas issued is climbing up at a fast pace!</em>

The process of getting a tourist visa is very straightforward, fast and it won’t cost you a fortune. Before we dig into the details, we should mention lucky countries that are eligible for a visa exemption. By the laws, upon arriving all the visitors must provide a valid passport, proper invitation letter, and the flight ticket (<strong>you can travel to Vietnam with a one-way ticket</strong>).

Anyway, some countries have a mutual agreement with the Vietnamese government when it comes to visa exemption.

Precisely, the passport holders from <strong>22 countries around the world can enter Vietnam without an invitation letter for a visa</strong>.

<hr />

<em>If you’re holding one of these passports, you will be able to visit Vietnam for <strong>15 - 90 days without a visa:</strong></em>

<strong>14 days:</strong> Brunei, Myanmar

<strong>15 days:</strong>  UK, Spain, France, Italy, Germany, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Finland, Russia, Belarus, Japan, South Korea

<strong>21 days:</strong> Philippines

<strong>30 days:</strong> Thailand, Cambodia, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Laos

<strong>90 days:</strong> Chile

<hr />

<em>What’s the process if you’re a passport holder from the countries on the list, but you decide to stay longer than 15 days?</em> Well, there are a few possible options that will cost you money and time. The first option is visa renewal that can be done in the main Immigration Department in Hanoi, Da Nang, and Saigon. The best way is to go on their official website and check the process for doing a visa renewal. Always be sure that you check the <a href="https://www.myvietnamvisa.com/vietnam-visa-exemption.html"><strong>updated information on visa exemptions</strong></a> since you don't want to get to the immigration and find out you need a visa for Vietnam.
<div class="single_post_info_box"><i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle fa-2x"></i> If you’re traveling to Vietnam without the visa, you can’t do a visa extension.</div>
If you want to avoid the huge costs of visa renewal, the best option would be to grant an invitation letter for a Vietnam visa that can be easily obtained <strong>through many agencies for $25 (3-month single-entry visa)</strong>. With that option, you can save yourself a lot of time and money, even if you won’t stay in Vietnam for that long.
<h2><b>So What’s the Process for Travelers Who’re Not in the List Above?</b></h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3531" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.vietnam-flag.jpg" alt="Vietnam flag in Hue" width="1009" height="751" /> If you’re not born under the lucky star and you’re not a passport holder from the countries above, don’t worry, as getting and staying in Vietnam is relatively easy to process. You can get your approval letter from the Vietnamese embassy in your country or simply by arranging a travel agency that is specialized for visa-on-arrival. The main options for a tourist visa are a <strong>1-month and 3-month visa</strong> that can be a single or multiple entries. If you’re not sure about your traveling plans and you might get out of the country before the stamped date, then investing a little bit more money to get a multiple-entry visa is what you should think about!

<em>Once you’ve figured out the type of visa you’d like to get, then it’s time to get your hands on the invitation letter.</em>
<h3><b>a) Going to a Vietnamese Embassy in Your Country</b></h3>
Going to the embassy is a great option, but it takes a lot of time, especially when you compare it with the online visa application. If you decide to go that way, then you need to book an appointment to the Vietnamese embassy in your country and bring a passport and two passport-sized pictures. You will get a form that you fill with your information and that’s it. In a few days, your letter will be in your post and email. It usually takes up to a week to get a letter that way.
<h3><b>b) Applying Through Online Travel Agencies</b></h3>
We prefer this option since you really don’t spend much time doing it. You need a picture of your passport and personal pictures. There is an online form where you fill in your details and after 2 days you get the invitation letter that you just need to print out and show to the immigration officer at the airport.
<div class="single_post_info_box"><i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle fa-2x"></i> We’re Croatians, so we can write through our perspective, but keep in mind that process and requirement may vary depending on your passport. Please call the Vietnamese embassy before starting the process, so they will update you with the newest information and requirements for getting your Vietnamese visa.</div>
Check out this website for <a href="https://www.myvietnamvisa.com/visa-requirements.html"><strong>updated information on visa requirements</strong></a>.
<h2><b>How to Get a Visa on Arrival?</b></h2>
This process is mainly used by travelers around the world as it saves tons of money and time. You don’t need to go anywhere, and you just need to apply online with your information. After a few working days (depending on the company) your invitation letter is ready and you can fly to Vietnam. Visa on arrival is the type of document that enables a holder to get a visa issued.

Every letter needs to be approved by Vietnam Immigration Office. Once it’s approved, you get the stamp on the letter and show it to the immigration officer at the airport and you will get a visa sticker for days that are stated in the letter. <em>Easy, right?</em>
<div class="single_post_info_box"><i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle fa-2x"></i> If you’re getting to the country by plane, be sure that you’re arriving at the international airport as you can only get a visa issued on these. International airports in Vietnam are Hanoi, Da Nang, and Saigon.</div>
<h2><b>The Procedure of Getting a Visa on Arrival</b></h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3534" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.vietnamese-visa.jpg" alt="Passport with stamps" width="951" height="643" /> As we already mentioned, the process of getting a visa on arrival is pretty easy and it doesn’t require much hassle.

<em>There you go: </em>
<ol>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Go to the official Vietnam Immigration website and navigate to visa on arrival section. You will get all the information needed to obtain the invitation letter. Another option is to find a reliable travel agency that can provide you with an invitation letter. It’s usually a faster process, but it a bit more costly as these agencies work on a commission basis.</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Fill the form with the information. You will need your passport and personal photos of you.</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">You pay for issuing the letter. It usually <strong>costs around $25 (three-month single-entry tourist visa)</strong>, but it depends on the type of your visa.</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">After the processing period is done, you will get an invitation letter on your email with further information. You need to print out the letter and bring it out with you. When you arrive at a department airport, you need to show the letter on the check-in counter or otherwise, they won’t let you through.</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">When you land to Vietnam, go to '<em>visa on arrival'</em> counter and prepare your letter, passport, pictures, and cash for a visa sticker fee. A fee for a <strong>single-entry visa is $25 and $50 for a multiple-entry</strong>.</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Once you get a visa sticker and a stamp, please check out the dates to be sure that everything is fine. If everything is fine, then head over to passport control.</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Holla! You’re officially in Vietnam! Don’t forget to pick up your luggage.</li>
</ol>
Getting a visa on arrival is the most popular option for tourists getting in the country because it’s very fast, safe and it won’t hit your wallet so hard.

<em><strong>But wait, it’s not the end of the options when it comes to getting a visa!</strong></em>
<h2><b>E-Visa</b></h2>
Electronic visa became popular in recent years and many countries implemented that process to get into the country for 30 days. In Vietnam, passport holders from some countries can get an e-visa that is basically an electronic document checked and signed by the Vietnamese government and it allows travelers to <strong>stay up to 30 days</strong>.

The only problem is that if you decide to stay longer in the country, you need to do a visa renewal which is very costly, and in the end, it will cost you much more money than getting a visa on arrival. Here, you can check out countries that are <a href="https://www.vietnamonlinevisas.com/"><strong>eligible for getting an e-visa for Vietnam</strong></a>.
<h2><b>I Want to Stay Longer in Vietnam! What Are the Options?</b></h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3529" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.experience-vietnam.jpg" alt="Stunning Phong Nha National Park" width="1339" height="716" /> Many travelers want to extend their stay in Vietnam after having a stunning experience in the country. It happened to us a few times already! At first, I came to Vietnam with a business visa for three months, and then I did a visa run twice. My brother overstayed for a few days in Vietnam (we will talk about it too and what’s the process and cost of overstaying in the country).

<strong><em>There are three different options when it comes to extending your stay in Vietnam:</em></strong>
<ol>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Visa extension</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Visa renewal</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Visa run</li>
</ol>
We’re going to provide you with the information on each option, so it’s up to you to choose the most suitable one for you and your current situation.
<h2><b>Visa Extension</b></h2>
Visa extension is the way to prolong your stay in Vietnam without leaving the country. It’s never cheap to do it without leaving a country, so this option can be very expensive. Basically, visa extension means that the Vietnamese government grants you more time in the country. You can do a visa extension in three main immigration offices around Vietnam including Hanoi, Da Nang, and Saigon. The process itself isn’t so complicated as you only need to go to immigration and fill the forms with basic information. You can extend your visa by another one or three months, depending on your current visa type.

<strong>More details: <a href="https://www.myvietnamvisa.com/vietnam-visa-extension.html#hmf">Learn everything about doing visa renewal and extension!</a></strong>

For instance, if you’d like to extend your visa for another month, then you need to have at least a one-month visa in your passport. The price for doing that<strong> varies from $50 - $160</strong>, depending on your nationality. If you’re planning to extend for another three months, then you need to have a three-month visa in your passport.

It costs <strong>from $170 - $320</strong>, again depending on your nationality.
<h2><b>Visa Renewal</b></h2>
Another option for travelers who entered the country on the visa exemption is doing a visa renewal. By doing it, you’ll get a new sticker and a stamp and the whole process is very similar to visa extension, but a bit more costly. You can renew your visa for the maximum three months and also, you can upgrade your current visa from 1 to 3 months and from single to multiple entries.

<em><strong>The cost is fixed and it will cost you $200 for a 1-month single entry, $330 for 3 months single, and $350 for 3 months multiple entries. </strong></em>

The whole process is going through the Vietnam Immigration Office in major cities.
<h2><b>Visa Run</b></h2>
The most popular option when it comes to extending your stay in Vietnam is by far a <em>‘visa run’</em>. Some nationalities can’t do a visa renewal or extension, so they are forced to leave the country and obtain a new valid visa to prolong their stay. This process is the cheapest one and it allows you to get a new visa for up to three months. Many travelers who decided to stay in Vietnam for a long time usually do visa runs every three months. The process is very similar to getting the visa on arrival. You need to apply for getting an invitation letter through a travel agency or immigration office.

Once you get the invitation letter, you must go to the international border (if you’re traveling by land) in Laos or Cambodia. You need to have a valid passport, letter and photos to obtain the new visa. Here's everything you have to know about the <a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/visa-run-vietnam"><strong>Vietnam visa run</strong></a> process, so prepare yourself and stay longer in Vietnam without problems.

Doing a visa run from Da Nang? Check out all details to do a <strong><a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/visa-run-lao-bao">visa run from Da Nang to a popular international border called Lao Bao</a>.</strong>

The route is scenic and historic since Quang Tri suffered a lot during the war. The whole process is pretty straightforward and it won’t take you more than an hour. Just be sure that you have all the documents checked as you don’t want to overstay in Vietnam. Also, you can travel by plane to another country, spend some time there and return to Vietnam.

That’s a bit more costly, but it’s still cheaper than doing a renewal or extension.
<h2><b>Transit Visa</b></h2>
Travelers who’re just passing through Vietnam to reach their final destination don’t need a transit visa. It’s a very convenient way to explore the country during your layover as there is almost no documentation needed to get a transit visa. The only problem with the Vietnamese transit visa is that you can’t leave the airport, but you can pass passport control in case you want to sleep at the airport.

It’s not the most comfortable place to sleep, so booking a hostel or hotel would make much more sense.

<strong>More information: <a href="http://www.vietnamvisa-easy.com/vietnam-visa-requirements/requirements-for-vietnam-transit-visa">Learn all details when it comes to transit visa!</a></strong>

The best way to organize your layover in Vietnam is to make a tourist visa for a month and just get out of airport to explore the city you’re in. If you don’t have time or energy to do it and you want to get a transit visa, the process is very straightforward. You need to present the immigration with a valid passport, a flight ticket to the third country, and a valid visa for the destination country.

That’s all the hustle you need to go through!
<h2><b>Avoiding a Visa Hustle and Travel Without a Visa in Vietnam</b></h2>
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-3532" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.phu-quoc.jpg" alt="Phu Quoc Island" width="910" height="624" /> Some people are luckier than others when it comes to visa exemption so they can travel to Vietnam for a certain amount of time without a visa. If you’re planning to visit Vietnam just to have a perfect vacation and relax a bit, then there is one option where you can get to Vietnam without acquiring a visa. Phu Quoc is the island in Vietnam territory that is classified as a ‘special economic zone’ which means <strong>all travelers get a visa exemption for 30 days while traveling to this exotic island</strong>.

<em>Getting a visa exemption is a relatively easy process, but you must be sure to meet the following criteria when applying for the exemption:</em>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">You need to have a valid passport that is not expiring in the next 6 months</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">You must have a round trip flight ticket with the final destination that is not Vietnam</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">You can only stay in Phu Quoc for 30 days</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">You don’t have deportation stamp on your passport or any offenses in Vietnam</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">You must not be on the Interpol list</li>
</ul>
Believe us or not, that is all you need to get a visa exemption! Be sure that you have all the documents and that you’re passing all the criteria before visiting the island.

Also, please do further research about visa exemption to Phu Quoc by visiting <strong><a href="https://www.phuquocislandguide.com/phu-quoc-visa/https://www.phuquocislandguide.com/phu-quoc-visa/">this site</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span>

<hr />

Now you have all the information when it comes to applying for a tourist visa in Vietnam. There are many options and it’s up to you to choose the one that suits your traveling plans. Please check the latest updates and policies before visiting the country, since the visa requirements change all the time for some country.

<em><strong>The best way to be sure is to</strong></em> <em><strong>call the Vietnamese embassy in your country before applying for any visa to make sure you have all the documents needed for a Vietnamese visa. </strong></em>

Wish you a safe trip filled with amazing experiences!]]></Content>

		<Content><![CDATA["<span style="font-weight: 400;">Imagine the number of struggles travelers had before the smartphone and globalization era! It was more complicated to navigate, understand a different language, figure out the accommodation or tour options, and ordering food online was just a dream. </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Luckily for us, we’re living in a technology era where almost everyone has a smartphone and access to high-speed internet is everywhere - even you can connect in the most remote areas!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">These luxuries back then, are today normal life commodities which make our traveling and exploring so much easier, without stressing out about planning and organizing things. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are countless mobile apps that are extremely useful for travelers who’re exploring Vietnam. </span>

<em><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this article, we’re going to provide you with the list of mobile apps that will make your exploration of Vietnam much easier since you won’t need to focus so much on logistics. Focus on exploration and experience and don’t forget to install these apps before setting your foot in Vietnam!</span></em>

<hr />

<h1 style="text-align: center;"><b>Accommodation</b></h1>
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-3559" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.accommodation.jpg" alt="Homestay in the northern Vietnam" width="898" height="603" /> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Traveling around the country requires proper planning and figuring out the logistics. One of the most important aspects when hitting the road is thinking where are you going to stay. It’s possible to set up your camping site almost anywhere (the permit is required for certain places), but for travelers who’re looking for a basic level of comfort, booking a room or a bed is more convenient. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>When it comes to booking the accommodation, there are few reliable apps that work like charm in Vietnam (and everywhere else).</em> </span>

<hr />

<h2><b>#1 Booking.com</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">You probably already heard for Booking.com even if you've just started with traveling. This app covers almost every country in the world (<strong>228 countries and territories</strong>) and it’s very intuitive to use. All you need is set up a profile (you can connect your Facebook account too) and fill the basic information about the preferred accommodation in the search like date, number of travelers, and place. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s it!</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a very good filter option that can help you in filtering the accommodation by your preferences. Not to forget, the community is amazing and people usually leave the reviews, so don’t forget to read some before booking your stay through the platform.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Booking.com has an interesting program for trusted members and you can get good discounts on your account after booking a few stays. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s called a Genius program and it’s very genius when you realize you get a <strong>10 - 20% discount</strong> on selected accommodation. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Another amazing thing about Booking is that for the majority of options, you don’t have to do a prepayment, instead pay on the site! </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s amazing for people who don’t like the accommodation once they come and see it by themselves. </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Go ahead, install the app, create a profile, and pick among the best accommodation options in Vietnam!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Platforms:</strong> iOs and Android</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Price:</strong> Free</span>

</div>

<hr />

<h2><b>#2 Agoda</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Basically, the same platform as Booking.com, but when it comes to scoring the cheapest deals, nothing can compare to Agoda. The listings at Booking and Agoda are almost the same, but the huge difference plays when it comes to price. </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Agoda usually gives their users best deals and discounts when it comes to accommodation options. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, the hostel is almost fully- booked, but there are still a few beds available and the company wants them all booked. They usually put their listings at Agoda and provide travelers with cheaper price than on other platforms; so-called last-minute deals. </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Many times, we stumbled on the same accommodation option, but totally different price. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re traveling on a strict budget, it won’t hurt to have Agoda installed just for a backup when checking the prices of stays!</span>

<strong>Platforms: </strong>iOs and Android

<hr />

<h2><b>#3 Airbnb</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Airbnb is another very commonly used platform among travelers who’re looking for more comfort and also ready to pay for it. The platform is working on the same principle as two platforms above, but the options are mainly related to apartments or houses. </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Airbnb is an amazing platform when you’re traveling with a group of people and you’re looking for a comfortable stay to recharge your batteries. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re traveling alone, booking the place through Airbnb won’t be the cheapest thing, but when you’re sharing the costs, then you can find amazing options like villas in the mountains or stunning homestays with local families. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Create a profile and start searching the options! Definitely a platform to give a try!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Platforms:</strong> iOs and Android</span>

<h1 style="text-align: center;"><b>Transportation</b></h1>
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-3568" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.transportation.jpg" alt="Transportation in Vietnam" width="890" height="590" /> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Transportation around Vietnam can be very tricky, especially when you take into account the chaotic traffic and <a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/scams-in-vietnam"><strong>many scams that are happening</strong></a> around the taxi scene. Many travelers will decide to travel around Vietnam by motorbike as that’s the most flexible and cheapest option when it comes to transportation, but what’s with the travelers who’re not comfortable driving in Vietnam?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t worry, there are many options when it comes to transportation without being ripped off.</span>

<hr />

<h2><b>#4 Grab</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Grab is a very convenient app for getting the fastest and cheapest transportation near you. At the beginning of 2018., Grab bought Uber in the SEA region and it became the biggest transportation company in that region. It’s very easy to use and the options for transportation are endless. You just create a profile and connect the app with your phone number so drivers can reach you out. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The app provides you with the map and different options around you. It’s very amazing how flexible Grab is since the app for Vietnam has the option of GrabAbike - you just call the motorbike taxi which is perfect for solo travelers. </span>

<em><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>There are many other options including a car for two, four, and up to 9 people.</strong> </span></em> <span style="font-weight: 400;">You set up your destination and depending on your driving option, you’ll get an exact price before even getting to the car. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Such a good way to travel around huge cities!</span>

<strong>Platforms: </strong>iOs and Android

<h2><b>#5 Skyscanner</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a huge possibility that at some point on your trip you’ll decide to take an internal flight around the country due to many reasons. </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many apps that are listing the flight options of different flight carriers, but we found Skyscanner the best and most reliable option. Using the app gives you the option to plan your timing, the budget, and much more when it comes to flying around the country and abroad. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Our tip is to always get the information about the flight on Skyscanner, but don’t forget to <strong>check the official flight company when booking the flight, since we had the experience that prices usually differ in the advantage of official flight companies</strong>.</span>

<strong>Platforms: </strong>iOs and Android

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Price:</strong> Free</span>

<hr />

<h2><b>#6 BusMap</b></h2>
<strong><em>Did you know that Saigon has more than 100 official bus lines that stop to about 2,000 places around the city?</em> </strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Navigating and figuring out the bus lines can be a real hustle in a busy Saigon. BusMap is an innovative app that helps the user to organize and navigate their trips around the city using public buses. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The app has many interesting features including calculating the shortest time to reach the destination. It can also suggest you which bus numbers to take to shorten your commute time. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t worry about the time table anymore since the app has an integrated time table of every bus line in Saigon. </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Unfortunately, the app currently only supports Saigon bus lines, but there is a huge possibility you’re going to explore stunning Saigon, so it’s smart to have that app in mind. The bus fares <strong>range between 5,000 - 7,000 VND</strong> which will save you a lot of money for exploring and experiencing the beautiful, often too busy city.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Platforms:</strong> iOs, Windows and Android</span>

<h1 style="text-align: center;"><b>Food</b></h1>
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-3563" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.food_.jpg" alt="Rich food culture in Vietnam" width="869" height="571" /> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone knows that Vietnam is a crazy culinary experience and the street food scene is huge! There are so many options when it comes to food which makes it very hard to pick the delicacy from the menu. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, the food is extremely fresh and cheap on the street, but sometimes, people simply choose other options than the street. </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes, you just don’t feel up for finding a new local food spot or the weather isn’t in your favor, so it’s easier to just order your food, relax and wait for it!</span>

<hr />

<h2><b>#7 Foody</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to food ordering in Vietnam, the first app that comes to our mind is definitely Foody. The app has amazing user experience and it’s relatively easy to figure out how to use it. The biggest problem is the abundance of options, so sometimes you can spend much time figuring out which type of food you’d like to order. </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">You can connect with social profiles or phone number to the app. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to ordering, you just write the type of food or location or category of food you’d like to eat and you’ll get the countless options.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"> Every place has the <strong>presented menu with the checkout prices</strong>, so you know how much you pay and also, the delivery cost is relatively low. </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">The app has an amazing community of people who constantly share the reviews and the photos of the food, so before ordering anything, you can check out what other foodie lovers think!</span>

<h2><b>#8 Vietnammm.com</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Another food app we really like has a very creative name - Vietnammm. The app has an amazing search engine that enables you to pick the location and even district (in bigger cities) and based on your inputs, you get the list of the restaurant options in the area. </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">You can connect with social profiles and receive stamps and milestones which leads to great deals, coupons, and discounts. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to payment, you can <strong>pay by cash, credit cards, or even PayPal</strong> which makes the app very flexible for foreign travelers. </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">The community is huge, so there are many pictures and reviews from people who tried food from certain restaurants.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Lozi is less of the app, but more a food-related social media. Lozi is a huge community of foodie lovers who’re <strong>sharing interesting tips, reviews, and main photos of food from different places</strong>. </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">You can connect with other people, talk about food, organizing food tours around the place, and much more.

We always do the exploration of the country on our own, but people who find it handy to just hop on an organized tour can find many options and special deals in Vietnam!</span>

<hr />

<h2><b>#10 Klook</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Klook is an amazing app that is very handy when it comes to organizing your trip or learning about the destination you’re traveling to. The platform provides you with organized tours, discounted prices for attractions and much more. </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">We were mainly using this app when it comes to getting tickets for museums or attractions since you can score pretty good deals on the platform. </span>

The platform is very popular and you can basically find any information about any place you’d like to visit. It’s a very good way to get the expectations in order before going to any place. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The huge community is very helpful since people write detailed <strong>reviews with the pictures and videos</strong> which can help you in clearing any doubts.

<h1 style="text-align: center;"><b>Navigation</b></h1>
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-3565" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.navigation.jpg" alt="Streets in Vietnam" width="909" height="488" /> <span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re living in a digital era where access to the information is just a few clicks away which makes traveling much easier and less time and money consuming as compared to a decade ago. When coming to the new country, there is one thing you can’t live without - a map. There are countless mobile apps that help you in navigating around the new places, and we included a few that have interesting features.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t have internet access, don’t worry since the map apps provide you with the offline maps and navigation that can definitely go handy, especially when traveling around remote areas.</span>

<hr />

<h2><b>#12 Maps.me</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The first map app that comes to mind is definitely Maps.me. This app is incredibly easy to use and intuitive and it’s a proper competitor to Google Maps. We used this app on our trip more often than Google Maps since you can use it offline and you can also download maps from other travelers with marked locations which gave us the information about off-the-beaten-path in some locations. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">T</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">here is also a GPS and many more roads than in Google Maps since the community updates the map continually which means you can even see the hiking trails and small paved roads on the maps.</span>

<h2><b>#13 Google Maps</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Good old Google Maps! We think there is not much to add when it comes to this app and probably every traveler used this app once during the travels! It can work offline too, but you can download the maps of the area first. We used this app occasionally around Vietnam, but we prefer Maps.Me. It’s very reliable to use this app when you’re driving between the cities or places, but once you’re navigating around the big cities, the app can be a real hell. </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">When trying to find specific places around the cities, the app will sometimes navigate you to a completely different part of the town. It can be very frustrating, especially when you have to be on time. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Anyway, it’s a very good navigation app that can help you in planning your route around the country.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">A good thing to know is the estimated time of the route Google Maps provide you. For instance, during the whole trip, our estimated time was constantly double than the estimation on this app. Many travelers share the same experience, so plan accordingly!</span>

<h2><b>#14 Coc Coc Map </b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">When traveling around Vietnam, it’s crucial that you have detailed information about the place you’re currently traveling to. Other map apps provide a decent level of information about the places, but there is not an app that can compete with Coc Coc Map when it comes to details. </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">The reason? All of the places are updated by the locals and drivers who use the camera feature to update the current database with the places. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, the app has <strong>more than 1 million places</strong> including ATMs, restaurants, gas stations, attractions, and much more in the database and the number is growing with each hour. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Want to explore the place like a local? Download the app and find the beauty in each place!</span>

When you travel in the groups it’s always easier to stay social, but once you hit the road solo, staying social can be a bit tricky, especially for introverted people. </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Anyway, there are amazing social apps that can help you meet people with the same interests so you will never feel alone on the road. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We constantly use social apps for connecting with new interesting people when getting to new locations.</span>

<hr />

<h2><b>#15 Tinder </b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Probably everyone heard about Tinder as there are <strong>about 50 million active users of the app worldwide</strong>. It’s usually seen as a dating app, but don’t be one-dimensional since Tinder has many benefits and good ways to use it when it comes to networking and socializing.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;"> Of course, you can use the app solely for a dating purpose, but also, you can connect with people who’re currently staying at the same place you’re in and who’re sharing the same interests as you. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s a perfect way to spend your time in the city and share your experiences and knowledge. You can easily connect Tinder with Facebook or your phone number and import pictures from Instagram or other social apps. Invest some time to get your profile ready, put your interests, and start swiping.</span>

<h2><b>#16 Zalo</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Zalo is an amazing and lightweight social app commonly used in Vietnam. The app doesn’t have the best-looking user interface, but once you get used to the app, it becomes effortless to use it. It’s a messaging app with many features like voice calls, video calls, group chats and calls and much more.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You can connect your social profiles like Facebook and Google+ to import your personal data. Also, it’s a good app for meeting new friends around you sharing the same interests. The community using the app in Vietnam is huge (<strong>we’re talking about 100 million active users</strong>), so it can be an amazing way to meet new interesting people!</span>

The barrier is real, especially in the countryside, but you will be shocked when you realize not many people speak English in the cities too. The best way to handle it is to learn basic phrases or simply have handy mobile apps at your hand.</span>

<hr />

<h2><b>#17 Google Translate</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to translation, the first app that comes to everyone’s mind is by far Google Translate. It’s a lightweight and easy-to-use app that will most likely help you in communicating and breaking the language barrier. Don’t put all of your bets on this app since the translations aren’t so accurate and sometimes it can give the people different meanings.</span>

The language barrier is just one of the culture shocks you will experience in Vietnam. Learn about other <a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/culture-shocks-in-vietnam"><strong>culture shocks and prepare yourself for what's coming</strong></a>!

<span style="font-weight: 400;">But anyway, in many cases, people will get the context and will be able to understand what you’re looking for. The app has an interesting feature where you can point your camera to a certain picture and get the translation of the picture. It really helps a lot when eating in local restaurants without the translation on the menu.</span>

Everyone has a limited budget when it comes to traveling or you simply don’t want to overspend and have a longer experience traveling around the country or the region. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s of utmost importance to keep track of your spending and currency exchange rates as it will definitely help you in not getting ripped off.</span>

<hr />

<h2><b>#18 Toshl</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Toshl is an interesting and interactive app that helps you in having your spendings in check. The app is a budget manager where you can input all of your spendings and categorize them. You can go in details when it comes to categorizing which means you can also add your own categories.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;"> It definitely helps a lot when it comes to budgeting and can help you with your spending habits. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The app has the statistics option where you can see the graphs of your spendings which go very handy when analyzing where your money is going. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">David was tracking his spendings during a 30-day motorbike trip and here’s how much it costs to<strong> <a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/vietnam-on-a-budget">travel around Vietnam on a budget</a></strong>!</span>

<h2><b>#19 XE exchange</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This lightweight app is totally intuitive and easy to use. There are not many options, but the name tells the purpose - checking the current exchange rates. You just put your desired rates and the app will return you the current and updated exchange rates for given currencies.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;"> This is a very crucial app have especially when exchanging money to VND or paying in the restaurants or for other services in a foreign currency. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Have in mind that locals will always give you a different rate, but at least the app gives you an edge when it comes to bargaining since in Vietnam people even bargain on the currency exchanges!</span>

The internet is fast, data is very cheap and almost every place you go is packed with fast and reliable WiFi. What more to ask for?</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">We always recommend buying a SIM card and data plan since the prices are very affordable and it provides you with connectivity even in the most remote areas. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you decide not to get a SIM card or a data plan, don’t worry, since the WiFi is on almost every step!</span>

<hr />

<h2><b>#20 WiFi Finder</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The app that helped us tremendously during our trip is WiFi Finder. Sometimes, you can’t access your data internet, so you have to rely on WiFi. What makes this app so useful is the amazing user-experience and only checked networks. The map in the app is <strong>updated almost every day</strong> which means new, fast, and reliable internet hotspots for you. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">All of the hotspots are verified and speed tested, so you don’t need to do any manual work when it comes to checking the specifications of the network. The amazing feature is the offline map; you just download the map of the city and you get all the WiFi information even when you’re offline!</span>

It sucks when you have to pay fees and conversions each time when you’re getting the money outside your card, and these fees can add up, especially when you travel for few months around this stunning country. </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t worry as there is an amazing option for how to save money on transactions!</span>

<hr />

<h2><b>#21 Timo</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Timo is the first digital bank in Vietnam powered by VPBank. It’s an amazing alternative for travelers who’re staying in Vietnam for a long time as you don’t have to worry about the fees that can add up pretty fast. </span> <em><strong>Creating Timo account requires literally 30 minutes and after a small process your account is set up and you have a physical card in your pocket. </strong></em>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The app is very user-friendly as you can plan your budget, make savings, check out the ATMs, and CDNs (where you can put the cash on the card). It’s not all since you can top up your phone, paying the bills and much more using the app. Ah, not to forget, the creation of the account is totally free and you can withdraw money on any ATM in Vietnam without paying a single Dong on fees. </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Create your Timo account now and enjoy the benefits!</span>

		<Content><![CDATA[<em><strong>A passionate cannabis smoker coming to visit Vietnam soon?</strong></em> We’re completely with you! When we were coming to Vietnam, we did a lot of research about the culture, traditions, routes, delicious food and places to see, but also, we didn’t forget to do huge research on getting and smoking cannabis in Vietnam.

We traveled around Vietnam with motorbikes, and <a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/vietnam-on-a-budget"><strong>you can check how much money we spent</strong></a> during the whole trip. In the report, you will notice that <strong>a huge piece of our budget went to getting cannabis.</strong>

Vietnam is definitely <strong>a weed-friendly country</strong> (from our experience) and getting your hands on some cannabis is literally effortless. The quality isn’t the best, but it’s going to get you a high for sure! In this article, we’re going to provide you with information about the laws, places to get cannabis, weed quality, our experiences and generally all the stuff you have to know about cannabis in Vietnam!

<em><strong>Don’t worry; you’re going to satisfy the weed addict in Vietnam!</strong></em>
<h2><strong>Cannabis Laws are Pretty Strict on the Paper but in Practice...</strong></h2>
<img class="wp-image-3976 size-full aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.cannabis-laws-vietnam-e1549297785160.jpg" alt="Cannabis laws in Vietnam are very strict on paper, but the implementation is not!" width="500" height="295" />
<div class="image_description">Cannabis laws in Vietnam are very strict on paper, but the implementation is not!</div>
Once we started to do research about cannabis in Vietnam, we directly jumped to cannabis laws, and we were pretty shocked! They still have a death sentence, and <strong>you can get executed by using or distributing drugs</strong>; cannabis included! The laws are mainly referring to imprisonment; if you’re lucky, but also, for selling or distributing, the penalties can lead you in front of shooting squad.

We were pretty shocked at first, and we said, alright, <strong>no cannabis for us!</strong> After an initial thought, we decided <strong>to find a way to get and smoke around the country</strong> and do the most detailed research ever! Later, after talking with many locals, expats, tourists and reading many stories on different forums, we concluded that the <strong>laws aren’t enforced by the police officers when it comes to cannabis; especially if a foreigner consumes it.</strong>

Vietnam wants to become a huge tourist destination and police doesn’t want to bother foreigners for smoking a joint since it can possibly make a country less attractive for young travelers. It has its benefits, but also many disadvantages. For instance, in major cities where there is a huge expat community, <strong>you can walk around the street and smell cannabis on each step.</strong>

That’s cool at first sight, but when you think a bit about local people living there, it’s probably not the best thing ever! We saw many people openly walking around the city while smoking a huge spliff without caring about anything or anyone. It’s generally OK to smoke, but always <strong>use your common sense while doing anything illegal</strong> in a foreign country.

Especially in Vietnam since the cops are very corrupt, so if they want, they will get a considerable bribe from you. Don’t be the guy who is smoking in the middle of the street during the day. It’s stupid and not respectful to local people.

<em><strong>Always smoke in secluded places, or nature, or bars where the owners are OK with smoking cannabis inside.</strong></em>

No matter what, don’t grow or sell cannabis. Even if you’re a tourist, you will end up in huge trouble and possibly in life imprisonment. Also, don’t think about smuggling cannabis from the other country to Vietnam.

There are a lot of <strong>places where you can score good quality cannabis</strong> around the country, so don’t worry that you won’t find any.
<h2><strong>How Hard is to Get Your Hands on Cannabis in Vietnam?</strong></h2>

<div class="image_description"><em>Check around the expat community in Vietnam; you'll probably find some weed and make friends!</em></div>
It really depends on the place where you are currently staying at, but generally, it’s straightforward to get some. The biggest concern is the quality and quantity! Don’t worry about it for now; we’re going to talk about it soon.

From our experience, it’s very easy to get a good quality weed in the places where there is an <strong>expat community.</strong> In touristic areas, it’s relatively easy to get cannabis, but the quality is questionable.

<script async defer src="https://widget.getyourguide.com/v2/widget.js"></script>

Traveling to Hanoi? <a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/weed-in-hanoi">Read about things you should know about weed in the capital!</a>

If you’re planning to travel around the country for a certain time, we advise you to <strong>get enough in Saigon, Da Nang, and Hanoi.</strong>

In these three cities, the expat community is huge, so you can connect with fellow expats who will introduce you to the cannabis scene. Inside the other touristic cities, there will be some places to get cannabis, but mainly <strong>taxi drivers will approach you to sell you some.</strong>

It’s up to you if you’d like to get it since <strong>many of them are scammers</strong> and sometimes, they can even work with the police, so we suggest you - skip it.

So, to answer your question - <strong>getting cannabis around Vietnam is literally effortless!</strong> With a bit of research, you can get all the information!

<strong><em>Don’t forget to check expat Facebook groups!</em></strong>

Here are some of them:

<h2><strong>Alright, but How About the Prices?</strong></h2>
<img class="wp-image-3978 size-full aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.weed-price-vietnam.jpg" alt="Weed price in Vietnam is very low compared to the Western standards." width="960" height="640" />
<div class="image_description"><em>Weed price in Vietnam is very low compared to the Western standards.</em></div>
Compared to western prices, the cannabis basically costs nothing in Vietnam.

The average price for <strong>a bag of 5 grams is 250k VND</strong> which is just a bit more than $10.

Although the quality isn’t the best, you will definitely feel a decent high. The baggie of 5 grams usually lasted us for 3 - 5 days, depending on our travels.

For instance, if we were staying in one place for longer, then the baggie would burn like crazy. If we were traveling on the motorbikes between the cities, then we wouldn’t smoke so much as we avoided to smoke on the road as much as possible. There are options to get high-quality indoor grown strains, but prepare your wallet as <strong>the prices are usually around 500k VND for a single gram.</strong>

It’s even more expensive than in Europe for the questionable quality. These prices and quantities are from expat bars and areas, but there is also an <strong>option to buy on the street from motorbike dealers.</strong>

As we already mentioned, we don’t advise you to do it as there are many scams related. More on that later. The prices on the street are usually <strong>900k VND for a baggie of claimed 5 grams.</strong> Sometimes, it’s not even cannabis inside the bag, and undoubtedly you won’t get the claimed quantity. You can always bargain the price, but don’t expect the price to go down so much.

If there is not another option for you, and you really want to smoke, then try your best to bargain and <strong>learn basic Vietnamese phrases when it comes to numbers.</strong>
<h2><strong>What About the Cannabis Quality in Vietnam?</strong></h2>
<img class="size-full wp-image-3982 aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.cannabis-quality.jpg" alt="Although the cannabis quality in Vietnam isn't the best; the cost/benefit ratio is pretty high!" width="4320" height="3240" />
<div class="image_description"><em>Although the cannabis quality in Vietnam isn't the best; the cost/benefit ratio is pretty high!</em></div>
Well, <strong>the quality isn’t the best in the world</strong>, but when you put the price in the consideration, then you get fair quality cannabis for pennies.

<strong>Every joint will make you mildly high</strong> which is perfect, especially if you’re up for cruising with the motorbike through the highway like that.

We usually stumbled upon three different types of weed in Vietnam:

<strong>Vietnam outdoor grown</strong> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3981" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.vietnamese-weed.jpg" alt="The Vietnamese weed is the cheapest you can get there, but also, expect a lot of stems and seeds inside the pack!" width="958" height="571" /> It’s the lowest quality and the cheapest. It’s working, but you need to put a lot in one joint. Also, sometimes, we experienced headaches from this one. The baggie will be full with stems and seeds, so you will need to throw much from it.

<strong>Cambodian/Laotian import</strong> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3979" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.cambodian-weed.jpg" alt="Cambodian weed import is the best one in Vietnam when talking about cost/benefit ratio." width="800" height="450" /> This is the best offer you can get in Vietnam. The price is very reasonable, and the quality is very good for Vietnam standards. We recommend you go for this option.

<strong>Canadian import/indoor grown</strong> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3980" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.canadian-import.jpg" alt="The Canadian import is mostly grown inside, and is very expensive." width="960" height="640" /> The most expensive one which is even more costly than European cannabis. If you want to spoil yourself, you can spend your money elsewhere or on other things. We don’t recommend smoking this type since Cambodian will give you the same effects. It’s up to you to choose the right type for you! We were mainly smoking Vietnamese schwag and Cambodian imports along the road.

Sometimes, from Vietnamese weed we experienced a slight headache, but except from that, everything was fine. Both types can work very well and give you nice experiences!
<h2><strong>What Are the Common Scams When It Comes to Cannabis?</strong></h2>
<img class="size-full wp-image-3989 aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.motorbike-taxi.jpg" alt="Most of the weed-related scams in Vietnam are related to motorbike taxi drivers." width="854" height="583" />
<div class="image_description"><em>Most of the weed-related scams in Vietnam are related to motorbike taxi drivers.</em></div>
From our experience, <strong>we only fell under one scam</strong>, and it was in Phan Thiet. We bought some cannabis from a motorbike driver as we didn’t have any cannabis left. The quantity was definitely not what he was saying it is, and it was probably the worst weed we’ve ever smoked!

<em>When your cannabis addict is desperate, you don’t ask, right?</em> The other scams from the stories of people are usually related to <strong>taxi and motorbike drivers.</strong>

They will sell you cannabis and then report you to the police. Afterwards, they will follow you back to your accommodation and bust you. After the bust, the police officer will ask you for a bribe, and then <strong>the seller and police are sharing the money.</strong> These two scams are usually the most common when it comes to cannabis in Vietnam. Our advice is: <strong>never buy cannabis from street dealers!</strong>

You will probably never experience a scam that way. If you really can’t avoid buying on the street, then, always <strong>ask to smell the bag and check the quality.</strong> Many street dealers won’t give you to do that, and then you can just walk away as it is probably a scam. <em><strong>Never forget to bargain!</strong></em>

When it comes to cannabis in Vietnam, <strong>we have a great overall experience!</strong> Antonio has been living in Vietnam (rural part of Nghe An province) for four months before we met in Hanoi. According to his experience, it was <strong>nearly impossible to find any cannabis in the countryside</strong> due to the language barrier, lack of connections and stigma related to cannabis.

He didn’t smoke any herb until we all met in Hanoi! When we all met in Hanoi, probably an hour after David’s and Lovel’s landing, we’ve found an interesting pub where <strong>you can openly buy, roll and smoke a joint.</strong> People around that area seemed very relaxed, and many foreigners are smoking weed there.

You're wandering around Hanoi without the success in getting your hands on any weed?

Read about <a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/weed-in-hanoi"><strong>cannabis scene in Hanoi</strong></a> and learn more about the prices, places and communities. <img class="wp-image-3975 size-full aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.smoking-joint-hanoi.jpg" alt="You can openly smoke a joint in some pubs in Hanoi!" width="632" height="843" />
<div class="image_description"><em>You can openly smoke a joint in some pubs in Hanoi!</em></div>
We were talking with some people about the situation of smoking weed in public places, and as we understood, <strong>police get fat bribes from owners </strong>who want to make weed available in their places. It’s very common around SEA, but you never know. For instance, in Da Nang, there is an expat area where people openly roll and smoke joints.

When you’re walking around the streets,<strong> you will smell cannabis on each step.</strong> Everyone knows about the situation, and many pubs are selling and paying the cops.

Anyway, there was a huge bust in one of the pubs where many foreigners and locals were arrested.

<em>After all, who knows how the bribery works with dirty cops?</em> <img class="size-full wp-image-3986 aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.high-times-hanoi.jpg" alt="Best idea is to smoke in secluded spots and just enjoy the vibes!" width="1499" height="843" />
<div class="image_description"><em>Best idea is to smoke in secluded spots and just enjoy the vibes!</em></div>
We suggest you to <strong>get cannabis in those places</strong> and get out as soon as possible. Always <strong>smoke at secluded places</strong> where you can be aware of your surroundings, and you’ll be fine. Alright, let’s go back to our experiences with cannabis... In Hanoi, the price of the bag was <strong>250k VND for 5 grams</strong> of surprisingly good cannabis. We bought four bags that will last until Da Nang where we planned to restore our stash.

The first thought when having few baggies of weed in our luggage was the police.

<em>What happens if the cops stop us and find cannabis on us?</em> We researched the police situation in Vietnam, and after reading experiences, we realized it’s totally fine as there is a <strong>small possibility you’ll get pulled over by the police in Vietnam.</strong>

In short, we just packed the baggies in dirty clothes, just to be sure! <img class="size-full wp-image-3983 aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.phong-nha-enjoy.jpg" alt="Phong Nha offers some breathtaking nature for its visitors. Enjoying weed is also pretty easy here!" width="1184" height="888" />
<div class="image_description"><em>Phong Nha offers some breathtaking nature for its visitors. Enjoying weed is also pretty easy here!</em></div>
We were running out of weed in Phong Nha, two more locations before reaching Da Nang. Luckily for us, the small town is <strong>full of tourists which means cannabis should be around.</strong> We booked a hotel there and instantly saw a guy on the reception wearing a hat with cannabis leaf! That was more than enough for us to talk to him! He was able to sell it, but in inflated price, so we decided to skip it and try to preserve our reserves till Da Nang.

When we were leaving the hotel, the guy approached us and gave us a gram of his stash for lucky travels. Such a good guy! <img class="wp-image-3984 size-full aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.hue-streets.jpg" alt="In the streets of Hue, you will most likely be spotted by guys on motorbikes who will follow you around and try to sell you marijuana. (in a very funny accent!)" width="1178" height="872" />
<div class="image_description"><em>In the streets of Hue, you will most likely be spotted by guys on motorbikes who will follow you around and try to sell you marijuana. (in a very funny accent!)</em></div>
After Phong Nha, we headed to the Imperial city of Hue for a night. We were surprised by how many taxi drivers offer you cannabis. You walk around the streets, and in 10 minutes <strong>you’ll get approached by ten drivers asking you about marijuana.</strong>

It’s very annoying after some time since the same drivers will approach you multiple times! We heard many bad experiences about these drivers trying to rip off tourists and even working closely with police reporting people and sharing the bribe with police.

Simply, <strong>say a friendly no</strong> to these offers and walk away! <img class="size-full wp-image-3985 aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.joint-rooftop.jpg" alt="Many joints were smoked on this rooftop!" width="1184" height="888" />
<div class="image_description"><em>Many joints were smoked on this rooftop!</em></div>
And then, we arrived in stunning Da Nang. We were utterly blown away by the city and its vibe. Really fantastic place to be! The expat community is huge and growing with each day. <strong>Weed bars are everywhere</strong>, and you can quickly get good quality cannabis for a fair price. Us three were able to find many pubs where nice people gather and smoke cannabis openly.

We joined for a few nights and restocked the supplies that will last us till Saigon (it was just our plan).

Getting to Saigon without any weed? No worries, here's everything you have to know about <a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/weed-in-saigon"><strong>weed in Saigon</strong></a>. <img class="size-full wp-image-3991 aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.da-nang-beach.jpg" alt="The beautiful Da Nang beach." width="1184" height="888" />
<div class="image_description"><em>The beautiful Da Nang beach.</em></div>
Da Nang is a crazy beautiful city with a <strong>great combination of urban and natural beauties.</strong> You can’t be bored in the city, and there are great nature spots that give you a view of the city and a long sandy beach.

Perfect place for smoking some cannabis and relax. We smoked so much weed in Da Nang, so we needed to restock a few times before leaving. Our stop in Da Nang lasted only four days! <img class="size-full wp-image-3974 aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.antonio-smoking.jpg" alt="Enjoying the joint in Phan Thiet!" width="1499" height="843" />
<div class="image_description">Enjoying the joint in Phan Thiet!</div>
The stash of ours lasted till the beautiful coastal town called Phan Thiet. We stayed there for five days spoiling ourselves on the beach and simply relaxing before ending our trips. It was an easy task to smoke all of our stash since we had just one bag left. <strong>Many taxi drivers around ATMs</strong> will offer you cannabis or something that looks like cannabis.

We heard many scams with these drivers, so be careful if you decide to buy from them. Of course, we bought one bag from them, and it was really expensive for the quality and quantity you get. We didn’t experience any scam except weed was really really bad! When we reflect on our overall experience with cannabis in Vietnam, we must tell that <strong>we feel extremely lucky that nothing bad happened.</strong>

The country is very corrupt, and the laws related to cannabis are very strict. We didn’t pay any bribe or getting in trouble with police officers along the way. Personally, we smoked a bit too much since <strong>we managed to finish around 60 grams of cannabis in 30 days of traveling.</strong> Our honest advice is to <strong>always use common sense</strong>, and if something feels not right, then it’s probably not right.

Listen to your intuition and just skip these situations. Be careful when buying from street dealers as there are many scams involved.

The best advice would be to <strong>connect with the expat community or check the groups on Facebook</strong>, so you will definitely get your hands on a piece of valuable information.
<h2><strong>Final Words for Cannabis Enthusiasts</strong></h2>
<img class="wp-image-3973 size-full aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.da-nang.jpg" alt="We had a great overall experience with cannabis in Vietnam!" width="2048" height="1690" />
<div class="image_description"><em>We had a great overall experience with cannabis in Vietnam!</em></div>
<em><strong>People who love cannabis won’t have any problems in Vietnam. </strong></em>As you already know, Vietnam is a stunning country with <strong>many breathtaking natural wonders and crazy beautiful roads</strong>, so it perfectly goes along with cannabis.

In major cities, cannabis isn’t seen as a vice by young people, and there is a huge community of smokers. The countryside is different since the values and traditions are still strongly expressed, so you will have a hard time finding some cannabis around the country and many strange looks when smoking around locals.

Use your common sense when doing anything cannabis-related and you will be more than fine. If something doesn’t feel right at first, then you should definitely skip it!

		<Content><![CDATA[There are many questions when it comes to driving motorbike legally in Vietnam. What kind of driving-license you should have, is an international license valid and recognized in Vietnam, how to use your insurance in case of the accident?

<em>Many questions, but lack of clear answers since the information can be very misleading because of constant changes in policies and laws related to the legality of foreigners driving in Vietnam.</em>

Don’t worry, we did research before starting our <a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/hanoi-to-saigon">epic motorbike trip around the country</a>, talked with a dozen travelers from different countries, and checked the updated information from the Vietnamese Department of Transport!

The whole process is much easier if you have a Vietnamese friend, but you can do it yourself as all the papers are translated into English, and officers (some) know to speak English.

<em>So, let’s go straight to the process! </em>
<h2><b>I Don’t Have Any Kind of Driving Permit. Can I Drive Legally in Vietnam?</b></h2>
<img class="size-full wp-image-4008 aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.driving-without-permit.jpg" alt="Scooter in Kon Tum" width="1002" height="753" />
<div class="image_description"><em>Driving without a license and prior experience can be very dangerous. We don't recommend it! If you experience an accident, the insurance won't cover you if you don't have a proper license.</em></div>
If you’re one of the travelers who doesn’t have any kind of driving permit but still wants to be safe and play by the rules, there is the option for you to take a theory and driving test in Vietnam and get a valid Vietnamese license! It’s advisable to have a driving license, not only because your and other people's safety, but also your <strong>insurance won’t cover you in case you had the accident</strong>. So think twice before sitting on the motorbike without valid papers! If you ever got stopped by the Vietnamese police it's very important to know <a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/vietnamese-police-guide">how to deal with them</a>!
<div class="single_post_info_box"><i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle fa-2x"></i> A good thing to know is that driving a 50cc scooter in Vietnam is legal and you don't need to have a special driving license to operate in Vietnam!</div>
<em>So, let’s say you decided to get a valid Vietnamese driving license, what’s the process?</em> You need to apply and fill the form for a driving license from the Department of Transportation, either in Hanoi or Saigon.

<strong>Address 1 (Hanoi):</strong> Office of Traffic and Public Works, 16 Cao Ba Quat Street (<a href="http://sogtvt.hanoi.gov.vn/">official website for Hanoi</a>)

<strong>Address 2 (Saigon):</strong> Office of Transportation, 63 Ly Tu Trong Street, Ben Nghe Ward, District 1 (<a href="http://sgtvt.hochiminhcity.gov.vn/Pages/default.aspx">official website for Saigon</a>)
<div class="single_post_info_box"><i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle fa-2x"></i> You can also do it in the other areas in Vietnam, but remember that most of the documents required for the application need to be verified by your embassy.</div>
<div class="single_post_info_box"><i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle fa-2x"></i> If you're located in the other provinces, we advise you to find a local friend who can help you talk with Local Police in the province/district you're in. Every province has quite different requirements and process when it comes to getting a new driving permit or converting your IDP.</div>
Once you’re done with your application, you need to verify and translate it. That can be only done by your embassy.

Here’s the<a href="https://embassy.goabroad.com/embassies-of/vietnam"> list of embassies and the addresses in Vietnam</a>. A fee of application vary depending on your nationality, but the <strong>cost won’t be higher than 500,000 VND</strong>. Once you have the application form signed, translated, and verified, it’s time to collect all the documents to proceed further.

<em><strong>Documents needed:</strong></em>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Valid passport</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Vietnam visa or residency permit that is valid for at least 3 months</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">4 passport size photos (Call the local department of transportation since the rules are different in every province)</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Health and eye test can be done in the majority of hospitals around Vietnam. The test with the documents costs 200,000 VND</li>
</ul>
Once you obtained all the documents and got a verified application form, it’s time to continue the process and go to the office where you’ve got your application from. Don’t forget to take all the documents with you. They will process everything and after a short process, you will be able to continue with driving and theory test.

The theory test is a bit complicated since it’s on Vietnamese and <strong>you need to learn up to 150 questions.</strong> The test has only 20 from 150 questions and everything is on Vietnamese, so it can be a bit tricky for foreigners to pass it! <strong>Theory test costs 400,000 VND.</strong> If you manage to pass a theory test, it’s time to do a practical test.

You go to the driving testing center and practice a bit. The test costs <strong>70,000 VND</strong> and it’s so easy to pass. Once you pass both tests, the process to obtain the license will <strong>take up to three months!</strong>

Not to forget, the total cost of getting a driving license in Vietnam is around 1 million VND. That’s it!

Congratulations as you just obtained your Vietnamese driving license and you’re officially legal motorbike driver on Vietnamese roads!
<h2><b>Converting IDP to Vietnamese Driving License</b></h2>
<img class="size-full wp-image-4009 aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.converting-idp-to-local-license.jpg" alt="Somewhere on the road" width="1008" height="752" />
<div class="image_description"><em>Converting your IDP to a local Vietnamese driving license isn't a hard process, but requires some time.</em></div>
If you already have a driving permit from your home country, it’s smart to make an international driving permit since you never know when you’re going to travel and drive abroad. In many countries around the world, IDP is recognized and you can operate vehicles, but in Vietnam is a bit more complicated! The IDP is sometimes accepted by Vietnamese police, but in the majority of cases, they won’t care.

It’s best if you have an IDP combined with a local Vietnamese driving license. In that case, you’re totally safe when it comes to health and motorbike insurance, but also police checkouts.

Once you have an IDP, you can easily convert it to a Vietnamese driving license without much hustle.

<em><strong>Here’s the whole process:</strong></em>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Get all the documents: 3 photos that are 3x4 cm, translated and verified copy of your IDP, a verified copy of your passport, original passport, original driving license, original residence card, a <a href="https://www.vietnam-immigration.org.vn/news/view/how-to-convert-driver-license-for-foreigner-living-in-vietnam-part-2.html">filled form of Transit Authority</a></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Once you collected all the documents, you should go to the Department of Transportation in Hanoi or Saigon</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Give all the documents to the officer and take another photo for their database. Officers will make the copies and scans of all documents and will return the originals to you.</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">After that, you need to fill a postal form and <strong>pay 30,000 VND</strong> for the service. Your driving license card will arrive at the stated address. You will get a receipt which you need to present to the courier. You will get all the information about the status of your driving license on your phone.</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Wait <strong>up to 10 days</strong> and you’ll get a driving license on the address you stated in a postal form.</li>
</ul>
<div class="single_post_info_box"><i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle fa-2x"></i> A Vietnamese driving license will enable you to operate the vehicles that are stated on your original driving license. It means if you have a license only for a car, you need to pass a practical test for a motorbike in Vietnam in order to drive motorbike legally. You are exempted from taking a theory test in this case!</div>
The practical test is very easy and it takes about 15 minutes to pass it. You’ll drive a route at the driving center that covers roundabouts, driving through narrow paths and bumps.)

Easy!

<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0bjAuUu3fzQ" width="764" height="430" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>

The process might look very long, but it is very straightforward to get a Vietnamese driving permit in your hands and drive legally around the country. Just be sure that you’ve collected all the documents before getting started with the process. For any assistance, just call your embassy and they will help you a lot. Also, if you have a Vietnamese friend, it can help a lot, especially through the process of applying and filling the forms.

		<Excerpt>Are you thinking of doing a visa run by yourself? Here are all process details and cost breakdown that will make your Vietnam visa run effortless.

		<Content><![CDATA[Are you planning to stay in Vietnam longer than expected and your visa is about to expire? If you're not working in Vietnam and don't have a work permit/TRC, the best bet to stay longer is by doing a visa run. At first, the whole process might sound complicated and scary but believe us, it's very straightforward to do successfully do your visa run. We did quite a lot of visa runs crossing to Laos and Cambodia on our motorbikes without experiencing any problems.

Keep reading as we've included all the details required for a successful Vietnam visa run.

<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Article </strong></span><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Update: </strong>We've completed the last visa run in October 2019. This version differs from the last one as you we've included more border crossings and details about each crossing. For now, it seems effortless to do a visa run and there is no limitation on the number of visa runs you can do. There are some talks about setting the limitations, but nothing actual still.</span>
<h2><strong>Getting All Required Documents on Time</strong></h2>
Before heading to the border, be sure to obtain all the documents for your new Vietnam visa. Here is the list of required documents and costs:
<h3><strong>#1 Visa</strong><strong> approval letter</strong></h3>
Be sure that you acquire a visa approval letter at least a few days before doing a visa run. The easiest way to get your letter is by contacting local visa agents who'll send you a letter in 2 - 3 days. We always use services from <a href="https://www.facebook.com/lynn.visaviet.1">Lynn in Da Nang</a>, a lovely lady who always sends us letters in 3 days! The price for a 3-month single entry approval letter is $25.

Be sure to bring an original letter since, on the land border, the immigration asks for the original letter with the red stamp and signature. Check if the dates and passport numbers are matching.

<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>UPDATE: </strong>If you're planning to do a visa run by flying out/in Vietnam, having a copy of the invitation letter is fine. </span>
<h3><strong>#2- Passport-sized photos </strong></h3>
Don't forget to take a few passport-sized photos with you. Even if you don't have photos that match the format, the immigration officer will hand the scissors to make the correct size (they aren't strict about the size). If you don't have photos, there is a penalty of $2 which differs depending on the border and 'mood' of immigration officers.

Also, you have to pay at the border for a passport photo, which costs around $10 for a single photo! You can get photos everywhere in Vietnam, and it typically costs around 50,000 - 100,000 VND.
<h3><strong>#3- Valid passport with at least four blank pages </strong></h3>
Check your passport and be sure that you have at least four blank visa pages and six more months before passport expiration.
<h2><strong>Vietnam Visa Run - A Step-by-Step Process</strong></h2>
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-4303 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20181128_135619.jpg" alt="Vietnam Visa Run, Apply for a visa on arrival" width="4160" height="3120" /> We've never experienced any problems during visa runs. Immigration officers tend to be very friendly (we even had a coffee with officers who were practicing English in Ha Tien) and helpful. A visa run process is the same for every border crossing, so no need for worry.

Since we're traveling around Vietnam and always coming back, we've completed quite a few visa runs:
<ul>
 	<li>Lao Bao (Vietnam)</li>
 	<li>Moc Bai (Cambodia)</li>
 	<li>Nam Phao (Laos)</li>
 	<li>Ha Tien (Cambodia)</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>#1 - Get your invitation letter on time</strong></h3>
Get an invitation letter from a reputable agency or someone affiliated with these agencies. Usually, it takes up to 3 working days to get the invitation letter from the agent. We pay $17 for a 3-month single entry and $25 for a multiple-entry approval letter.

<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>UPDATE: </strong>You must have an original letter (red stamp) for land borders, but a printed letter is fine for international airports.</span>
<h3><strong>#2- Plan your transportation</strong></h3>
Book a visa van or a bus or drive on your own to the border. We recommend driving on your own since the scenery is always stunning as you’re passing through breathtaking passes in the middle of Highlands to reach the borders. The van services usually cost around $50 - $100 depending on your location and how far is the border.

It’s a convenient option since the people will support you during the whole visa run process. We've never done a visa run without driving our bikes. The scenery is beautiful, you meet new people, try new food and experience different provinces around Vietnam. There are a few agents in Da Nang who charge $100 for a whole visa run process including the cost of letter and visas.
<h3><strong>3- Stamp out of Vietnam (Vietnam Exit Formalities)</strong></h3>
Once you’re on the border, you need to show the passport and the invitation letter. The immigration officer will check out everything, and if everything is okay, they will stamp you out of Vietnam. After that, you’re officially not able to stay in Vietnam anymore.
<h3><strong>#4- Apply for a Lao/Cambodian visa on arrival (Laos/Cambodia Entry Formalities)</strong></h3>
At the border, you pass one more passport control, and then you head to Laos/Cambodia immigration office. There are always a few cafes and local restaurants where you can fill yourself up. Once you reach Laos/Cambodia immigration office, you need to show your documents, including a passport, two passport-sized photos, and the invitation letter.

Then you will get a few forms to fill up with your information, and after you’re done, they will ask you to pay for a 1-month visa that costs around $35 (depending on your nationality). Once you acquire a new visa sticker, you have to stamp out from that country. Always check the dates on the stamps since there were stories of people overstaying because immigration officers messed with their stamps.
<h3><strong>#5 - Stamp out of Laos/Cambodia and enter Vietnam again (Vietnam Entry Formalities)</strong></h3>
Once you reach the Vietnam border, immigration will check your passport and visa again and point you in the right direction. A 3-month single entry visa costs $25, and you get it by showing the invitation letter and filling the forms. The immigration officer will stamp your passport (be sure to check it yourself) and point you in the right direction where another immigration officer will do the final check of your passport.

That’s all!

There are many steps, but usually, it goes like a charm, and you spend about 1 hour for the whole process once you reach the border. Even if you're going to do a visa run alone and don't know Vietnamese, don't stress yourself as immigration officers work with foreigners on a daily basis.
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Tips to Make a Vietnam Visa Run Effortless</strong></h2>
<p id="OyfFkoG"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5576 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5dd90685c37d9.jpg" alt="Vietnam Visa Run, Ha Tien Border Crossing" width="1063" height="791" /></p>

<h3><strong>#1- Bring passport-sized photos with you</strong></h3>
Don’t forget to bring photos since immigration will charge you like $10 for a single photo. Also, there are penalties for not having a passport photo (usually $2). You can take photos everywhere in Vietnam. Head over to the nearest Photocopy (or PhotocoPPy) shop and ask for passport photos. The bunch of photos costs about 50,000 - 100,000 VND.
<h3><strong>#2- Always check stamps and don't forget to stamp out before entering Vietnam</strong></h3>
Don’t forget to stamp out of Laos/Cambodia if you don’t want to walk twice. It happened to my friend once during the crazy high temperatures, and you don’t want that. Be sure that you check all the stamps in your passport before heading back to the Vietnam border. If you’re traveling by bike, there is parking before the Vietnam border, where you can park your bike for free and pick it up later.
<h3><strong>#3- USD is a king </strong></h3>
Pay in dollars! Exchange money before heading to the border as paying in local currency is always more expensive since officers like to get some money due to adverse exchange rates they give you.
<h3><strong>#4- Bring the original visa approval letter</strong></h3>
If you're planning to pass through land borders, it's required to have an original approval letter with a red stamp. You can have a printed letter if you're planning to fly in Vietnam through international airports.
<h2><strong>How to Do a Visa Run Through Land Borders</strong></h2>
<img class="wp-image-4024 size-full aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20180604_082531.jpg" alt="Land border crossings" width="4160" height="3120" />
<div class="image_description"><em>A beautiful nature, a lot of small lakes and wild rivers will be your company along the way to Laos. This landscape can quickly add up </em>a few<em> hours on your trip if you're traveling on your own since it's so easy just to stop and wonder.</em></div>
As we already mentioned, you need to get out of Vietnam and enter another country to get your brand new Vietnamese visa. The most convenient countries to do so are Laos and Cambodia. You need to go to the international border crossing as these are the only places that will be able to issue a new visa.
<h3>Visa Run to Laos</h3>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Tay Trang</strong></li>
 	<li><strong>Nameo</strong></li>
 	<li><strong>Namkan</strong></li>
 	<li><strong>Keoneua</strong></li>
 	<li><strong>Chalo</strong> - It’s a bit busy border crossing in Quang Binh province, and it wasn’t possible to get a Laos visa without a prior arrangement. Right now, it’s possible to get a Laos visa with only filling the necessary forms.</li>
 	<li><strong>Lao Bao </strong>- we wrote a detailed <a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/visa-run-lao-bao">guide on doing the visa run from Da Nang to Lao Bao!</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Visa Run to Cambodia</h3>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Moc Bai</strong> - it’s one of the busiest border crossings since the border is on the route from Saigon to Phnom Penh. It’s very convenient to do the crossing there as the officials are very knowledgeable about the process and they are speaking English (well, some of them!). We've crossed from <a href="https://vietnamchronicles.com/day-5">Vietnam to Cambodia on motorbikes</a> through Moc Bai. It was effortless, but be aware of scams on the Cambodian side.</li>
 	<li><strong>Vinh Xuong</strong></li>
 	<li><strong>Tinh Bien</strong> - Locals usually use this border crossing, and it’s not a busy one, so if you don’t want to spend so much time on processing your visa, this might be the right crossing for you!</li>
 	<li><strong>Ha Tien - </strong>The westernmost border crossing which isn't usually busy. We've crossed from Cambodia to Vietnam through Ha Tien on our motorbikes without any problem.</li>

		<Content><![CDATA[So, you've become interested in visiting Vietnam? There's a huge possibility that you'll land in a colorful capital Hanoi. When it comes to weed, cannabis laws are very strict on paper, but in practice, it's a totally different story. Hanoi is a very vibrant city that radiates with culture and tradition. Certain developments were being made, but still, you can walk around the center and enjoy local cuisine, drinks, and vibe. What could be a better way to dip in the experience than lightning some cannabis?

<em>We traveled to Hanoi and did research, so in this article, you'll get all the information on getting and smoking weed in Hanoi.</em>
<div class="single_post_info_box"><i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle fa-2x"></i> <strong>Disclaimer</strong>: This article was not written to promote the use of illegal substances, but to make their consumption as safe as possible. You should you decide to break the law on your own accord. VietnamChronicles does not condone the consumption of cannabis. Be safe and responsible!</div>
<h2><strong>Cannabis Laws</strong></h2>
<img class="size-full wp-image-4246 aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.weed-laws-in-hanoi.jpg" alt="Traffic in Hanoi" width="1280" height="960" />
<div class="image_description"><em>Cannabis laws look very strict on the paper, but in the practice is a totally different story. Don't forget to use your common sense and don't be a stereotypical tourist in Asia! ;)</em></div>
Like we already mentioned, Vietnam has very strict laws when it comes to drugs, and yeah, the government put the weed in the same category as opium and other very destructive drugs. There are many stories and articles about 'horror' stories when it comes to smoking weed in Hanoi, but through our experience and talks with other people, we have a totally different impression. According to their laws, any activity related to cannabis is strictly illegal and you can end up in prison for a long time if you get caught. Also, there are some mentions in the law that you can get executed for cultivating or selling a lot of plants.

Vietnam recently opened itself to investors, so it's an emerging tourism country, especially for Chinese tourists. When you look at the laws, the majority of them doesn't apply to tourists, especially when we're talking about cannabis.

<script async defer src="https://widget.getyourguide.com/v2/widget.js"></script>

There are so many expats in Hanoi who are openly smoking around the city and even in some bars. Hanoi is popular for a few bars where you can buy and smoke weed without any trouble. Just use your common sense and smoke in secluded places where you're not surrounded by thousands of tourists and you'll be fine.

In case you get caught with cannabis, you'll probably get outside the trouble by bribing the police. <em><strong>Note #1: </strong>Vietnam, as a whole country, is very known for corruption. </em>

<em>Police officers don't have a huge salary and they see the business opportunity when they catch a western tourist. Don't be hesitant to offer a bribe and also don't accept the first price as these bribes are highly negotiable. Just use your common sense all the time and you'll be fine.</em>

<em><strong>Advice: </strong>Always have a separated wallet with <strong>500,000 - 1,000,000VND</strong> ($20 - $40) in case you have to pay a bribe. The reason for that is, in some cases, police will take everything from your wallet if they notice more money. This amount of money can get you outside small trouble connected with cannabis.</em>
<h2><strong>Where to Get Weed in Hanoi</strong></h2>
<img class="wp-image-4247 size-full aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.where-to-get-cannabis.jpg" alt="Cannabis plant" width="1280" height="853" />
<div class="image_description"><em>From taxi drivers, weed-friendly pubs to delivery to your doors. The options are endless!</em></div>
It's very easy to get your hands on weed in Hanoi, but it's harder to get a good deal. If you don't have much time to explore Hanoi and you want to get cannabis fast, our advice is to visit Hoan Kiem Lake in the Old Quarter. During the night hours, the taxi drivers will usually offer you a motorbike ride and marijuana.

If you decide to take cannabis from them you should always check the bag as there are many scams when they put some other herbs or tea instead of cannabis. Also, the prices are high for a schwag you'll get. The price in the Old Quarter is around <strong>200,000VND ($20) for a gram.</strong> If you have more time in Hanoi, we suggest you visit a few smoking pubs and bars where you can openly smoke.

There are many places around the city like these, mainly known by expats. Our advice is to join the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/hanoiexpat/about/">group with other 16,000 expats</a> in Hanoi and meet up with some to get insights not only for weed in Hanoi.

There are many pubs/bars where you can score decent quality cannabis. Try out the <strong>Tet Bar in Hoan Kiem District, Apini Pub near Flower Market or Rastaman Pub in Tay Ho</strong>. We know these three places, but there are more places popping out with each day.

<em><strong>Note: </strong>Don't be afraid to smoke in these pubs as these are kind of rackets with police. The owners are paying a bribe for a certain period which means no police controls of these pubs during these periods.</em>

There is a delivery guy who can deliver the highest-quality homegrown and imported buds directly to your doorstep! Check out <a href="http://hanoistoners.blogspot.com/">his page</a> and what he's got to offer! :)

Another good way to score some weed is by checking backpacker hostels around Hanoi. These are filled with westerners who are looking for crazy time in Hanoi.

Ask people who're working on reception and they will probably help you out!
<h2><strong>Cannabis Prices in Hanoi</strong></h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4244" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.enjoy-hanoi.jpg" alt="Bridge over Red River in Hanoi" width="1280" height="853" /> The prices for a schwag are very low, but also the quality of the bud follows the price. For 5 grams in pubs, you can expect to pay around <strong>200,000VND </strong>($10) which is a great deal. Also, weed quality is decent! If you're buying from taxi drivers, you can expect to get the low-quality schwag filled in a cigarette pack. The price of around 10 grams is around <strong>400,000VND</strong> ($20).

Taxi drivers will always ask you for more, but always negotiate the price in Vietnam! There is an option to get your hands on imported kush from Laos and Cambodia, but it will cost you around <strong>500,000VND</strong> ($25) for a gram.

<hr />

The cannabis laws on the paper are very strict, but in the practice, it's very easy to get and smoke cannabis discretely. Just use your common sense to avoid trouble with the police. Also, don't forget to bargain all the time as it's part of the culture in Vietnam! Enjoy your stay in Hanoi! :)

		<Content><![CDATA[Many people ask how the celebration of the most meaningful Vietnamese holiday looks like. It's literally impossible to write a detailed answer to a dozen people who asked me that question, so I figured out the best way would be to share the experience here. I mean, it's the main purpose of blogging, isn't it? The whole journey and celebration of the Tet holiday have a special meaning to me and it made the connection between Vietnamese people and me so much stronger.

Once again, they showed their extreme hospitality and friendliness. Also, it's strange, but we became so good at understanding each other without even talking about the same language. Sometimes, we were able to talk like for an hour without having a single word on the common language, but body language is a universal tool of communication. Such an amazing thing to experience!

<em>I want to say big THANK YOU to all Vietnamese people and my dear friends who shared this beautiful journey with me! </em>

<em>If there is something I'm certain of, then it is the thing that the journey won't be the same without all of you!</em>
<h2><strong>How Did Tet Holiday Celebration Look for Me?</strong></h2>
Well, it was amazing and at some moments very blurry and hard to remember since Vietnamese people love their alcohol (and me too)! Sometimes even too much. If you ever come to drink with locals, be prepared that they are very proud drinkers and they will definitely try to outdrink you.

I was lucky that during my time in Vietnam I was living with few families and met a crazy amount of local people in Da Nang while volunteering. Many people invited me to their homes during Tet, but I was only able to visit a few. The final decision was to visit three provinces - Ha Tinh, Nghe An and Thanh Hoa.

The whole trip lasted for a bit more than two weeks and I stayed with three families, one in each province. I was driving 'Dragan', my trustworthy Honda Wave that passed through heavens and hells with me but still rocking solid. My beloved bike clocked just a bit less than 2,000 km on this trip. I decided to try something different in this article - going visual with a bit of text since the picture says 1,000 words.

<em><strong>Well, in the end, why not to try and test new things?</strong></em>
<div class="single_post_info_box"><i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle fa-2x"></i> <strong>Note:</strong> All photos were taken by my phone that was slowly dying on the way and these are not the highest quality, but can definitely show you the vibe and how it all looked like.</div>
<h2><strong>1st stop - Ky An, a small industrial village in Ha Tinh province</strong></h2>
In Ky An, I was invited by a good friend Vu who I met in Da Nang. I was living with his family for four days and during that time I've met so many people, friends, and family. Also, I experienced the culinary heaven of traditional food and rich preparations for the Tet holiday.

<em>Here you can feel the vibe from that special place:</em> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4182" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20190127_101950.jpg" alt="" width="4160" height="3120" /> Overlooking Ky An was really nice. People in that small village are mainly Catholic and it's shocking how many churches they have. Also, they put an extreme amount of effort and money to build those since they pay attention to every detail.  It always looks foggy around here, but it's actually not a fog - these are the gases from the huge international corporation that is located here.

It creates jobs around here as it seems like every person works for the corporation which is good short-term, but again, they are slowly killing their sea and air which will definitely come with the price for this and many other generations. Also, don't forget that the majority of people around here lives from seafood and farming.

What's your thought on it? Are you for a short-term or long-term?

Or maybe you see a balanced option that can benefit all the people now, but also, won't have a negative effect on generations to come?

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4183" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20190127_103408.jpg" alt="" width="4160" height="3120" /> We moved down from the hill and visited the church. It's still in a construction phase without much work being put on. Around the church, there are many community buildings where locals usually hang around. Also, kids play football on the rocky field barefoot. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4184" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20190127_103852.jpg" alt="" width="3120" height="4160" /> This is how the church looks like now. It's probably one of three or four churches around there. Maybe there are even more, who knows? You can see they are done with outside construction and they slowly moved to detail phase. It's funny that only a few people work on it and they are definitely taking their time while working on it.

Read, having a thousand smoke and beer breaks. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4185" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20190127_122738.jpg" alt="" width="4160" height="3120" /> Vietnamese people love their coffee time! They have such a strong coffee culture and amazing coffee (mainly robusta, for coffee enthusiasts). We usually drink Ca Phe Sua Da which is translated as coffee with milk and ice. If you never tried <a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/vietnamese-drip-coffee-guide">Vietnamese coffee</a> don't be surprised how creamy and sweet it is.

They use condensed milk as a sweetener that gives a special creamy texture. Some people can't stand it as at the times, it can be extremely sweet! Also, you always get free tea and you can drink as much as you can. Tea is very tasty and sometimes really strong. Depending on the province, people combine different snacks that go well with coffee - in Ha Tinh, they like their sunflower and watermelon seeds.

It is so easy to make a mess! <img class="aligncenter wp-image-4186 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20190127_123115.jpg" alt="Sunflower seeds everywhere" width="3120" height="4160" /> After a few minutes, the floor looked like this! It was full of sunflower seed shells and it's totally normal around here. Everyone is throwing everything on the floor and people just don't mind. The bartender just swipes it away once the people leave the table and the floor is ready for new customers faster than a blink of the eye. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-4187 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20190127_133503.jpg" alt="Playing video games" width="4160" height="3120" /> Oh yeah, not to forget - a gaming culture is huge among Vietnamese youth. It was very impressive and at the same time shocking to bump on these gaming rooms everywhere! Literally, there are places with nothing, just a few stores and of course a full gaming room. Majority of these works during the whole night, so many young people come there before sleep to play some games with friends.

It's also very shocking to me to see very young kids spending hours there instead of playing outside and experiencing a beautiful nature. How different is the childhood now! Not judging, since Croatia and other parts of the world are no different. But just an interesting observation when you how a traditional lifestyle is slowly getting influenced by technology and modern lifestyle.<img class="aligncenter wp-image-4188 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20190127_143636.jpg" alt="Catching our own food" width="3120" height="4160" /> In the countryside, you reap what you sow. We were catching some chickens for the barbeque later. People around here don't earn much money, but they usually live in their house with the family, raising animals and growing their own food.

People here live self-sustainable and it's nice to be around there as you learn many things about the food and the way they grow and treat the food. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-4189 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20190127_220637.jpg" alt="Rice wine and hot pot goes together" width="4160" height="3120" /> A blurry photo is posted for the purpose! People in Vietnam love their drinking time! It's called Nhau and it's basically drinking and eating without any reason. They are doing it almost every night with their friends and family. It's amazing how good and diverse food they eat. Of course, there is no Nhau without beers and tons of rice wine.

It's sometimes annoying when you focus on eating and every second someone wants to cheers with you. After a while, you forget and don't mind. Also, they have a culture of drinking everything bottoms up, even the beers. That's so heavy for the stomach and I'm struggling to keep up with their beer drinking pace. At the table, you can see their iconic hot pot.

They burn a fire below the pot and inside the pot, there is a liquid or a broth. When the broth is getting hot, mix raw meat and fresh vegetables to make a delicious soup! <img class="aligncenter wp-image-4190 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20190128_133635.jpg" alt="Beach in Ky An" width="4160" height="3120" /> One of the fishermen villages I had a chance to visit. The beach is visibly polluted by all kinds of human waste, like almost every beach in Vietnam. People here are simply not educated about pollution and its effects on the environment. Also, it seems like it's in their culture to litter. Anyway, people around Ky An live mainly as industrial workers, farmers, and fishermen.

It's very crazy to see huge industrial boats on the horizon. This part of the sea is totally flocked with these kinds of boats. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-4191 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20190128_140507.jpg" alt="Homemade fish sauce and shrimp paste" width="4160" height="3120" /> This is the local way how to make a fish sauce and shrimp paste. I personally don't like any of it but can eat the fish sauce with some food. Shrimp sauce has a very strong smell to me and I'm simply allergic to it.

The woman was showing me how she makes both sauces and what kind of fish and shrimps she is using. It was a good knowledge to get since these two are basically staple sauces when it comes to Vietnamese cuisine. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-4192 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20190128_142158.jpg" alt="Fresh local food" width="4160" height="3120" /> All that you can see on the table is fresh and locally made. That's what I'm thinking when I'm talking about self-sustainability. People don't have much, but they have everything they need. The food is very delicious and fresh.

We were eating cooked squid combined with rice paper and tasty mint. Also, there are baby shrimps that are used to make a shrimp paste and some kind of beef sauce that goes good with the food above. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-4193 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20190128_164854.jpg" alt="Preparation of Banh Chung" width="3120" height="4160" /> Many locals don't use the gas or electric stoves - they simply build a fire and cook on it. In this huge pot, there is a traditional food called Banh Chung which is the sticky rice combined with some beans and sometimes meat. It's a traditional food for the Tet holiday and it can make you totally full in seconds. It's full of calories and people usually mix it with sugar when eating.

I'm not a huge fan of it but can eat a few pieces. They also wrap it in banana leaves and it looks like a wrapped gift. It's a good gift for the families while visiting at the time of Tet holiday.<img class="aligncenter wp-image-4194 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20190128_203019.jpg" alt="Preparing chicken for BBQ" width="4160" height="3120" /> Preparing a chicken we caught before for the barbeque. People here seem like they are doing it every day so they are doing it so fast. As you can see, they have football dresses on since they just came from a football match. Football is a huge thing around there and almost everyone is playing football. They have teams and they compete against other teams.

People just rent a football field and play against each other. It's such a good and healthy way to connect with people, but also it's a good excuse to drink after. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-4195 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20190128_215322.jpg" alt="Enjoying a delicious dinner" width="4160" height="3120" /> A chicken that we caught before. We were dipping the chicken in all kinds of spicy sauces while drinking a beer. People here love spicy food as it makes you thirsty and what's the better way to kill your thirst than drinking a cold beer.

Also, Vietnamese people usually drink everything with a ton of ice. I don't personally like to drink a beer with the ice, but in Vietnam, it's hard to avoid it. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-4196 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20190129_131203.jpg" alt="Ky An market" width="3120" height="4160" /> It was so funny experience buying a winter hat since it was very cold to drive around that time. We went to the local market and soon, there were like 20 people around us looking at me as an alien. I guess they rarely see a foreigner.

They were very friendly and treated me very nice. Also, there were some people talking English, so they were asking me do I need any help or what I'm looking for. Such a nice bunch of people.<img class="aligncenter wp-image-4197 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20190129_132504.jpg" alt="Ky Anh market" width="4160" height="3120" /> Local markets in Vietnam are very colorful and lively. You can buy literally anything there and it's the place where some people socialize as there are few local eateries and cafes around. I always have a great time just walking around these markets. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-4200 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20190129_155856.jpg" alt="In Ha Tinh countryside" width="3120" height="4160" /> After a few amazing days in Ky An, it was time to say goodbye and move a bit north to visit another friend in Com Xuyen. It's a small village located on the off skirts of Ha Tinh city. The place is beautiful, but the people are noticeably scared of foreigners (or just me?). I was lost around since it's very hard to find an exact house there and I was asking people for help and in some moments they were really terrified and running away from me.

It was probably because I didn't remove the full face helmet and people rarely or never saw a foreigner around. Anyway, I spent like an hour driving around these beautiful rice fields while looking for my friends' house. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-4201 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20190129_162941.jpg" alt="A proper Vietnamese meal" width="4160" height="3120" /> After finally meeting each other, we went to eat and drink a few beers. He invited me to a traditional restaurant to eat duck liver salad. It was very tasty. You always mix it with rice bread and fish sauce mixed with garlic and chill peppers. Also, a cold beer goes so good together since all of this food is a bit spicy.

I was literally starving at that point so I ordered a chicken soup that isn't on the picture.
<h2><strong>2nd stop - Vinh City, the center of Nghe An province</strong></h2>
After visiting my friend in Ha Tinh, my goal was to reach Vinh City where a good friend of mine is working and living. I planned to stay one night and to continue my way to Cau Giat, a town where I was <a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/starlight-english-center-vietnam">volunteering as an English teacher</a>. On the first night, I knew I will prolong my stay there since I've been to Vinh City many times, but never had a chance to roam around the city.

<em>Here are a few photos from Vinh City:</em> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-4204 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20190130_115333.jpg" alt="Huge bowl of fried rice" width="4160" height="3120" /> Fried rice - one of my favorite dishes around Vietnam. It's different as you travel through the country and also, it has a different name. For instance, in the north, it's called Com Rang, while in central Vietnam it's called Com Chien. I was missing a huge bowl of fried rice so much! I was driving around Vinh in the morning and I was aimlessly looking for a place to eat. I always go to the restaurants or street places where I see a lot of locals eating.

You know you will get amazing food for an affordable price there. I saw a Pho place filled with locals, so I was like, let's check it out. As soon as I got inside I saw they are preparing fried rice and I was like, let's eat it! It was so delicious and so huge! I almost couldn't finish the bowl! It was so good to eat it again. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-4205 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20190130_125143.jpg" alt="Driving through rice fields" width="4160" height="3120" /> On the way to Ho Chi Minh's hometown. It's a small village located just outside Vinh city. The whole distance is about 15 kilometers, but it's easy to get lost around countless rice fields that are around.

The road is pretty nice and you're passing through small and charming towns where you can stay for a quick caffeine refill. The most amazing thing for me on the route is that you can drive through rice fields and small villages which gives you a completely different experience. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-4206 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20190130_132103.jpg" alt="The place where Ho Chi Minh was born" width="4160" height="3120" /> It's the house where Ho Chi Minh was born. The house is fully built from bamboo and palm tree leaves. Also, people living in that period were extremely short as the ceiling is so low. Another interesting thing from the house is that they didn't have a furnished floor as every floor was just made of mud. The house inside is totally traditional and simple.

People had few bamboo beds, one or two hammocks, and a traditional kitchen where they were setting the fire and cook directly on the fire. And yeah, they had tiny gardens around the house where they were raising all kinds of vegetables and sugar cane. It was a pretty simple, but self-sustainable lifestyle around there.

Also, I bet they weren't littering on each step like they usually do nowadays.<img class="aligncenter wp-image-4207 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20190130_133842.jpg" alt="Stunning gardens" width="4160" height="3120" /> This is the rest of the village where Ho Chi Minh was born. The village is very well preserved as many workers are taking care of it. It really amazed me how actually the whole place looks so furnished and chilled since there are not many visitors there (at least not at the time when I was visiting).
<h2><strong>3rd stop - Cau Giat in Nghe An</strong></h2>
Cau Giat is a small town located on the national highway QL1. The town is 250 km southern from Hanoi and about 60 km northern from Vinh. It's a very meaningful destination for me since I spent 4 months volunteering as an English teacher there. I haven't seen people and the place for about 6 months, so I was very excited to come there.

My initial plan was to stay there for two days, but I prolonged it to 4 days since there were some old friends coming in and I met amazing new friends on the way. It was very hard to leave one more time.

<em>Here are some photos from my time in Cau Giat:</em> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-4211 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20190131_151300.jpg" alt="Rice fields in Cau Giat" width="4160" height="3120" /> Ah, that smell of the rice fields...It's simply hard to explain the smell, but it smells like home. The majority of people in Cau Giat live from the rice, livestock, seafood (a bit out of the town, but in the district) and there is a huge pineapple plantation near. It's amazing to see that many people and households are almost totally self-sustainable. Even they don't earn much money on a monthly basis, they manage to have their basic needs met.

It struck me all the time to see that we don't need much to survive and live a good life. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-4212 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20190131_152033.jpg" alt="Overlooking national highway" width="4160" height="3120" /> That's the bridge across QL1 national highway in Cau Giat. I was usually coming here during the night to just chill and drink a beer with fellow volunteers. Also, this place is always filled with people after 8 pm. Some people come here to socialize, some people even come here to train. It's a lively place at night and really cool to be here one more time. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-4213 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20190131_181002.jpg" alt="Meeting my students" width="3120" height="4160" /> I was randomly driving around the town to get the vibe, and stumble upon these twins! They were my students back when I was teaching here. Their family has a small clothing shop so I saw them playing with some toy rifles in front of the shop. I pulled the motorbike and said hello, but they ran behind the counter just looking at me with the smile. I was calling them and they were a bit shy but they remembered me.

After a minute they run to me and hug me. It was a very emotional moment and we were hugging each other for minutes. It was an amazing feeling when you see your students after a long time. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-4214 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20190131_230634.jpg" alt="Coming home" width="2592" height="1944" /> Quang and Sue, the part of the family. I missed these two kids so much! They are growing so fast and they are getting much better in English. It's such a pleasure to see these kids are growing in a positive direction so fast.

We had a lot of fun during these few days. They were showing me many tricks and plays they learned during the time I was away. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-4215 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20190201_130354.jpg" alt="Rice fields in Cau Giat are magnificent" width="4160" height="3120" /> There is a small hill overlooking the whole town where I usually went when I needed to recharge my batteries. In Cau Giat there are three rice harvests per year and no matter which time you go to the hill, you have a different vibe and a look. I love to play the guitar and sing songs on that hill. Also, remembered the moment when I bring my brother here. We were just sitting here, drinking beers, looking at the stars, and talking about life.

This hill is definitely magical and holds a special place in my heart. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-4216 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20190201_145149.jpg" alt="Trying different Ao Dai costumes" width="4160" height="3120" /> Ao Dai is a Vietnamese traditional dress that people usually wear during weddings or special and meaningful periods like Tet holiday. It's a very beautiful costume with many details. I was lucky to get invited by locals to the shop. I tried a few Ao Dai costumes, but they didn't have my size so it looked very funny. Did you know that you can get a tailored Ao Dai in Hoi An?

It's a perfect idea for a <a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/souvenirs-from-vietnam"><strong>souvenir from Vietnam</strong></a> that will last. The people who were wearing it were stunningly beautiful. We went outside and took some photos for the upcoming Tet holiday. In the shop, there were two funny kids who were eager to learn some English, so while the people were trying different dresses, I was playing with the kids. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-4217 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20190201_150528.jpg" alt="A huge waiting line for ATM" width="4160" height="3120" /> A totally random photo, but needed to share it with you. This is the waiting line for the ATM! There are at least 30 people waiting in front of this ATM and it's impressive for me how chilled they are in the row. If that happens somewhere like in Croatia, someone would get hurt for sure! People are spending much money on decorating and preparing their homes for the Tet holiday since it's their most meaningful holiday of the year and it can be quite expensive.

The same situation was in front of every ATM for a few days. One day I woke up around 6 to drive a bit and there were still waiting lines at that time! If you're traveling through Vietnam around Tet holiday, be sure to have cash prepared since you may end up in a waiting line! <img class="aligncenter wp-image-4218 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20190201_152553.jpg" alt="Orange trees acting like a Christmas tree" width="4160" height="3120" /> Does the photo above remind you of stacked decorated Christmas trees? People in Vietnam, instead of Christmas trees, have orange trees. It's very interesting since they decorate these trees with all kinds of colors and lights and it actually looks like the Christmas tree. When it comes to oranges, people told me it's not good to eat since they used a huge amount of fertilizers when growing.

Anyway, I tried a few oranges, and it was so bitter that I couldn't eat it. Probably people were right! <img class="aligncenter wp-image-4219 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20190201_164901.jpg" alt="Quynh Phuong beach in Quynh Luu district" width="4160" height="3120" /> Quynh Phuong, a beach located just 15 km away from Cau Giat. It's not touristic place and the beachfront just went through some minor developments like building a boardwalk and there are few restaurants. At that time, the beach was almost empty and nothing was working since almost every business is closed for the Tet holiday. It was such a good vibe to chill and get a fresh breeze. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-4220 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20190202_125131.jpg" alt="Famous Thuoc Lao" width="4160" height="3120" /> At the time of the trip, I was trying to stop smoking cigarettes, so I got hooked to this baby called Thuoc Lao. It's a bong mainly made from bamboo or in some instances from metal and people use it to get high. How does it work? Well, you fill the pipe with tobacco, then burn and inhale the smoke. The tobacco is pretty strong and it gives you the lightheadedness feeling. Few times, I almost got unconscious after taking a big hit. Be careful when you're taking Thuoc Lao and always have some liquid next to you.

People in the north simply love their Thuoc Lao and you can find it in almost every cafe or restaurant. In central or South Vietnam, it's very hard to find one as the culture is a bit different. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-4221 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20190202_143109.jpg" alt="Overlooking Quynh Nghia beach" width="4160" height="3120" /> Quynh Nghia beach from the mountain. We climbed the mountain and were prized with this view. It's a very nice way to recharge your batteries being near the sea on the fresh air. The place is about 15 km away from Cau Giat. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-4222 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20190203_160036.jpg" alt="See you again Nghe An province" width="4160" height="3120" /> Every time when I see this sign, I get chills. I'm very connected to Nghe An province and its people so I always feel weird when I'm leaving. This time, I was driving the bike with my friend Chien and we were heading to his hometown in Thanh Hoa province that starts just after this sign.
<h2><strong>4th stop - Thanh Hoa Province and Chien's Hometown</strong></h2>
After a short but amazing visit to Cau Giat, I met Chien (a best friend from Da Nang), and together, we jumped on my motorbike and drove all the way to his hometown. I spent 4 days in his hometown and celebrated Tet holiday with his amazing family. There were many funny, crazy, scary and beautiful things that happened.

<em>Here are some pictures from Thanh Hoa province:</em> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-4225 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20190203_180425.jpg" alt="My best friend Chien and me" width="1944" height="2592" /> Chien and I just arrived in his hometown in Thanh Hoa. Nothing much of the picture, just to see our faces after his first trip with the motorbike outside Da Nang. He was driving the whole province and there were moments where I was completely scared for our lives. But luckily, we arrived safely at the destination. His family greeted me with a few shots of beer and Thuoc Lao hits.

In Vietnam, people are drinking bottoms up with beer and it really makes you drunk very fast since their pace is hard to follow. Also, they love to eat while drinking which is a great habit since the hungover is minimal. We were doing like that for the 3 days in a row, but after 3 days your body is simply telling you - STOP!<img class="aligncenter wp-image-4226 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20190203_212728.jpg" alt="In the karaoke room" width="3120" height="4160" /> Vietnamese people are keen to their karaoke and it's the part of the culture. Friends and family gather together and usually sing their favorite songs while drinking overpriced beer and eating fruit salads. It's impressive how much effort they put in furnishing karaoke rooms. Every room looks so luxurious, even in the most remote places.

We got so drunk there and after a blast time in the karaoke room, we just continued with the party at Chien's family home. It's hard to be the only foreigner around these people as everyone wants to cheer with you and it's inevitable to stay sober. Some karaoke has a huge selection of songs. In Da Nang, I was able to sing a few Croatian songs!<img class="aligncenter wp-image-4227 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20190204_132559.jpg" alt="A tasty and creamy egg coffee" width="3120" height="4160" /> As I already mentioned, Vietnam has a deep coffee culture as well as their export of coffee is one of the highest in the world. Vietnamese people simply love their coffee with condensed milk. I must say it's one of the most delicious and strongest coffees I had a chance to try. This one is the best egg coffee I ever tried.

The egg coffee is made by mixing coffee, condensed milk and egg which gives you a tasty coffee with a strange creamy texture. Some people love it, while some people hate it. I'm in the first category! Egg coffee is extremely popular in the north, mainly Hanoi, and it's a real struggle to find it in central or South Vietnam. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-4228 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20190204_164026.jpg" alt="Beautiful limestones in the middle of nowhere" width="4160" height="3120" /> The landscape around Thanh Hoa is stunning and it reminds me of Ninh Binh province that we had a chance to visit during our epic motorbike trip around the country. We took the bikes one day and randomly driving around to energize our bodies since it was a day before Tet.

For Tet, you simply had to have a lot of energy since people drink like crazy and you can't expect to go to sleep early. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-4229 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20190204_165625.jpg" alt="Overlooking Thanh Hoa city" width="4160" height="3120" /> This is the view over Thanh Hoa city from the monument that pays respect to heroic mothers during the American war. We were greeted with an amazing view and a beautiful sunset over the city. Such a unique moment to be there! <img class="aligncenter wp-image-4230 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20190205_014741.jpg" alt="Celebrating Tet holiday as local" width="4160" height="3120" /> Ah, the night of Tet looked like this. We started to drink at 10 am in Chien's family house until 10 pm. During that time, I met a crazy amount of locals who were extraordinarily nice, and of course, they all wanted to cheer as the sign of welcome to their town. I was just trying to follow up and I made it! 12 hours of hard drinking! I didn't know what was following...

Well, we came back to Chien's house around 10 pm and chill a bit while drinking a few beers and smoking a few Thuoc Lao. Chien asked me to go to visit his friend nearby. We went there and we got really drunk at that house. When we were going back to his house, we met his brother and friend on the street. It was a group of 20 drunk people singing and going to visit every house around the town to give the best wishes for the Tet.

We started our march to visit all the houses and the thing is that you have to drink in every house you visit. We started around 12 pm and I remembered throwing up in the lake around 4 am. The next day I woke up with a huge hangover, headache and I was unable to open my eye. A crazy night for sure it was!<img class="aligncenter wp-image-4231 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20190205_173831.jpg" alt="Stunning sunset" width="4160" height="3120" /> A beautiful sunset captured from Chien's house. It's amazing how simple people live here. They don't have much but they have enough!<img class="aligncenter wp-image-4232 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20190205_191215.jpg" alt="An eye virus" width="1944" height="2592" /> Me next morning after Tet night. It looks like I got hit in the face, but no, I managed to get some eye virus. At first, I didn't want to take the medicine since I knew I will be drinking, but after Tet night it started to look very bad.

I've got some medicine and creams and everything settled to normal pretty fast. Some older people had it and they were told it's very dangerous and it can spread around the whole body. I was so lucky nothing serious happened.<img class="aligncenter wp-image-4233 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20190206_124545.jpg" alt="A proper lunch with the family" width="4160" height="3120" /> A traditional meal in Vietnam. People here eat very healthy and diverse cuisine. Usually, they put a bamboo mattress on the floor and stack the food around while people are sitting in the circle, next to each other. There is a lot of alcohol involved too, but luckily for me, I didn't drink any since I was on the medicine.

Some people were drinking for 5 or 6 days in a row and still going strong. It's crazy how much Vietnamese people can drink.
<h2><strong>Going back to Da Nang</strong></h2>
After celebrating a lunar new year in Thanh Hoa it was time for me to return back to Da Nang. There was a long way in front of me and it was impossible to do it in one day, so I broke the trip into three parts.

I visited family in Cau Giat again (along with visiting a friend from Da Nang around Quynh Luu district), stopped in Ky An to visit family, and then from Ky An drove 350 km all the way to Da Nang.

<em>Here you can see a bit from the trip back home:</em> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-4237 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20190206_164048-Copy.jpg" alt="Trying a betel nut on a traditional way" width="3120" height="4160" /> On the picture above, you can see a traditional preparation of betel nut or quid. This nut has a significant meaning in Vietnam culture and today, you can see older people consuming it. Consuming this nut for long periods makes your teeth black, so that's one of the reasons you can stumble to people with complete black teeth. An interesting fact is that the black teeth were the standard for a beauty a long time ago.

The combination of a nut, powder, and leave is used as chewing gum and the taste is similar to a minty gum. It's said it gives you energy and more brainpower, but I really didn't get any of these effects. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-4238 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20190206_221328-Copy.jpg" alt="Random drinking" width="3120" height="4160" /> Meeting some random families around Cau Giat. I met a few new friends in the small town, and they were visiting some friends, so I was going there with them. The families are always so warm and welcoming. You instantly feel as you're at home while visiting a Vietnamese family. Of course, there was tea, rice wine, a lot of sunflower seeds, and Thuoc Lao. An interesting fact is that Vietnamese people believe the sunflower seeds will make you lose your voice.

I don't know if it's true fact or they were just telling me that as I was literally killing all of their sunflower seeds. These seeds are so addictive! <img class="aligncenter wp-image-4239 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20190207_123739-Copy.jpg" alt="Visiting families around the country" width="4160" height="3120" /> This is another family I've met in Quynh Luu District. It's about 15 km away from Cau Giat and these are father and mother of my friend from Da Nang. We didn't have a chance to spend more time together as the timing was very tight, but still, had a great time with, you can guess - a Thuoc Lao, strong tea, and plenty of sunflower seeds. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-4240 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20190208_151528-Copy.jpg" alt="A view from Hai Van pass. " width="4160" height="3120" /> Almost reaching home! It's the view from the top of Hai Van Pass which is just 25 km away from Da Nang city center. I was greeted with sunny weather and not the best visibility. Usually, on clear days, you can see a whole city and the beach from this point. This place is one of the top touristic places around central Vietnam, and I won't tell you about the beauties of the place since everyone is talking about it.

I will tell you about the problem of littering! People, what's wrong with you?


<img class="aligncenter wp-image-4241 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20190209_104150-Copy.jpg" alt="Linh Ung pagoda in Da Nang. " width="3120" height="4160" /> I'm living in Da Nang for the past 7 months and it was my first time visiting Linh Ung pagoda or how we like to call it; Lady Buddha. It was an amazing place that is by far overcrowded. But if you're patient, you can have a truly great experience and also, stunning views over the city. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-4242 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20190209_123130.jpg" alt="Enjoying egg coffee and Thuoc Lao" width="3120" height="4160" /> Getting a tasty cup of egg coffee (can't compare it to the one in Thanh Hoa!), few hits of Thuoc Lao, and having a great day with an amazing person is a great way to put the end of this short, but meaningful journey.

<hr />

This was the overview of my two weeks on the road while celebrating Vietnamese New Year with local people. I have tons of pictures and so many more experiences to share, but it is impossible to include all of them. I'm sorry if I didn't include something that was very meaningful to some locals that I met on the road, but believe me, I remember all of you guys!

<em>Thank you one more time for making Vietnam much closer to my heart!</em>]]></Content>

		<Content><![CDATA[Vietnam is such a diverse country in all aspects! Whenever someone mentions Vietnam, probably the first associations are delicious fresh food, wide smiles from friendly locals and breathtaking landscape on each step. What many people don't know is that Vietnam is one of the best kitesurfing locations in the WORLD! The 'S' shaped country has around 3,260 km of pristine coastline where people can chill under the coconut tree at endless sandy beaches.

Also, the climate makes Vietnam a very attractive kitesurfing surfing location since the southern coast is gifted with reliable winds, tropical weather, stunning beaches, and surrounding landscape, and what's most important - a fast-growing kitesurfing community. Kitesurfing in Vietnam became worldwide recognized and today, there are many locations where adventure junkies can find their place along the long coast.

Have you ever heard about Phan Rang? Probably not. What if we tell you that Phan Rang kitesurfing is one of the best adventure experiences in Vietnam?

Let's dip down straight to things you should know before going to Phan Rang to kitesurf!
<h1 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Where is Phan Rang?</strong></h1>
<iframe style="border: 0;" src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d257404.84328188535!2d108.85784893976441!3d11.662227334241873!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x3170d00efca47ebf%3A0x7633637b6e0f3bfa!2sPhan+Rang%E2%80%93Th%C3%A1p+Ch%C3%A0m%2C+Ninh+Thuan+Province%2C+Vietnam!5e0!3m2!1sen!2s!4v1553401847628" width="600" height="450" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>

Not many tourists visit or know about this small coastal city located on the southern coast of Vietnam, more precisely in Ninh Thuan province. The city has an ideal location for people who're traveling around Vietnam since it's literally situated between Nha Trang and Mui Ne on the coast and Da Lat in the mountains.

<em><strong>Every location is about 2 hours drive from quiet Phan Rang.</strong></em>

If you're looking for a quiet and authentic destination that luckily has pristine sandy beaches, stable winds, and local vibe, then you should definitely head over there! The majority of travelers who visit Phan Rang stay solely because of kitesurfing.

There are two main kitesurfing spots - <strong>My Hoa Lagoon and Ninh Chau Bay</strong> where you can catch nice winds and calm waters during the peak season (through the year too).

Locals mainly live from seafood and believe us, the seafood there is DELICIOUS! They know how to make a great meal with fresh food. There are a dozen of hiking spots, national parks and waterfalls around the city which you can explore between kitesurfing sessions.
<h1 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Phan Rang Kitesurfing Season - When Is the Best Time to Visit?</strong></h1>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4285" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.phan-rang-kitesurfing-season.jpg" alt="Phan Rang kitesurfing season" width="914" height="643" /> Do you want to hear an interesting fact about Phan Rang? The literal translation of the city name is <em><strong>'Wind &amp; Sun'</strong></em>! It is simply a place where passionate kitesurfers and adventurers go! The peak season for kitesurfing is from <strong>December to March</strong>.

You can kitesurf during the whole year, but the wind direction changes so you'll have to change a location a bit to catch a proper wind. In Phan Rang, there are two seasons - <strong>high and low season</strong>.

High season is often busier than a low season and the weather is more favorable for kitesurfers. It starts in October and ends around April when the low season kicks in. Many people usually visit Phan Rang during the peak (high) season, but if you don't have a chance to visit during these months, don't worry, since the weather and winds are stable even during the low season.

<a href="https://www.windy.com/11.577/108.987?10.963,108.987,8"><strong>Here you can check the real-time wind conditions in Phan Rang!</strong></a>
<h1 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Best Phan Rang Kitesurfing Spots</strong></h1>
With an average of 25 knots, Phan Rang is the perfect spot for kitesurfers during the whole year. During the peak season, you can expect a steady 25 knots during the most days. If you're visiting during a peak season don't be surprised to get 40 knots!

<em>There are three places you want to be if you're coming to Phan Rang with kitesurfing in your mind:</em>
<h2><strong>My Hoa Lagoon</strong></h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/v7TWZVKvEv4" width="764" height="430" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>

The main spot for kite surfers is definitely My Hoa Lagoon. The lagoon is located on the South China Sea coast and the wind blows from N/NE direction with the a<strong>verage speed of 25 knots</strong> (cca 12 m/s) through the whole year.

The lagoon is about 20 km outside the city and kitesurfing community recognized the potential, so it became a tiny village mainly with many kite schools and cool places where other adventurers hang around. It's such a cool vibe and nice people around, so if you're visiting Phan Rang because of kitesurfing, then we definitely recommend this place!

My Hoa Lagoon becomes the best place to kitesurf during the high season (<strong>November to April</strong>) since the weather is sunny and temperatures average at 30ºC. There are days with light wind, but still, the speed is <strong>not getting below 15 knots</strong> (cca 8 m/s) which is still ideal for a nice session (+beginner friendly).

During some days, wind speed can reach a <strong>whopping 40 knots</strong> (around 20 m/s) which will give you some serious fun in the water! The lagoon is highly affected by tides while coral reefs surround the lagoon. During the worst tide periods, you'll have to walk a few hundred meters to reach the water. Be careful when kitesurfing on low tides since you'll be surrounded by rocks and coral reefs.

Plan it out beforehand and arm yourself with proper equipment. During the high tides, you'll be gifted by shallow and calm water with a sandy ground.
<h2><strong>Ninh Chu Bay</strong></h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4280" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.ninh-chu-bay.jpg" alt="Ninh Chu Bay" width="1161" height="644" /> This bay is the ideal spot for kitesurfing during the low season (<strong>March to September</strong>). Although the wind is a bit weaker, still, the average <strong>speed reaches 17 knots</strong> (8 m/s). During the most afternoons, windspeed <strong>reaches stable 25 knots</strong> (12 m/s). Low season is known for a different direction of the wind that blows from the south in the morning.

During afternoons, the wind tends to shift its direction from south to the southeast which gives stronger and stable wind. Did you know that Ninh Chau Bay hosted the huge competition back in 2016. getting the biggest names in kitesurfing on these waters? The competition was called Kiteboard Tour Asia and it hosted about 100 competitors doing freestyle and racing on the winds.

<em><strong>Here's a stunning video from Kiteboard Tour Asia in Phan Rang:</strong></em>

Ninh Chau is a huge chunk of sandy beach, so if the winds aren't in your favor, you should move a bit south until you find the perfect winds. Also, the water conditions are close to perfect. Shallow and calm water is perfect for beginners and also, you won't reach deep waters in the first 100 meters.
<h2><strong>Main Phan Rang Beach</strong></h2>
This beach is often used for swimming and relaxing, but still, the winds there are pretty solid and consistent throughout the whole year. Although the winds are a bit weaker than in the two locations above, still you can expect an <strong>average 15 knots</strong> during high season, and about 20 knots during the low season.
<h1 style="text-align: center;"><strong>How to Get to Phan Rang</strong></h1>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4281" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.pristine-sea-in-Phan-Rang.jpg" alt="Pristine sea in Phan Rang" width="967" height="641" /> Phan Rang is the quiet city with a chilled vibe not discovered by mass tourism, YET. The place has the ideal location and is it sits on a triangle between Da Lat, Nha Trang, and Mui Ne; all three major touristic destinations.

<em>You don't have to worry about getting to Phan Rang since there are few convenient options:</em>
<h2><strong>By Bus</strong></h2>
The bus can easily be the most convenient way to travel around Vietnam, but when it comes to reaching small, non-touristic destinations like Phan Rang, the bus drive can become a nightmare in a blink of the eye. Anyway, Phan Rang does have a bus station that sits on the infamous QL1. The exact location is <strong>between QL27 and Truong Dinh Street</strong>.

Have in mind that the bus lines are very limited, so it's advisable to plan ahead. There are many taxi drivers who are waiting in front of the bus station, but be aware of the scams! Always bargain and have the map open!

<em>The most famous bus routes to and from Phan Rang:</em>

<strong>HCMC:</strong> Daily departure from 4am - 10am (150,000 VND)

<strong>Nha Trang:</strong> Daily departure from 6am - 3pm (70,000 VND)

<strong>Phan Thiet:</strong> Daily departure from 6am - 1pm (70,000 VND)

<strong>Da Nang:</strong> Daily departure at 4 pm (sleeping bus, 200,000 VND)

<strong>Hue:</strong> Daily departure at 4 pm (sleeping bus, 250,000 VND)

<strong>Vung Tau:</strong> Daily departure at 8:15 am (140,000 VND)

<strong>Buon Ma Thuot:</strong> Daily departure at 6 am (sitting bus, 110,000 VND) and 8:30 pm (sleeping bus, 150,000 VND)
<div class="single_post_info_box"><i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle fa-2x"></i> Keep in mind that you can basically drop off from any bus that is passing Phan Rang. Just kindly ask a driver to drop you off near the bus station!</div>
<h2><strong>By Train</strong></h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4282" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.train-to-phan-rang.jpg" alt="Heading to Phan Rang by train" width="1149" height="640" /> Luckily, for travelers who explore the country by train, Phan Rang is located on the main railway route that connects North to South. The name of the train station is <strong>Thap Cham</strong>. Many travelers who're traveling from North (Da Nang) or South (Saigon) pick this option as it provides you with stunning views through beautiful mountain passes, sandy dunes, rice fields, and ocean. If you're a type of person who loves options (who isn't?), then you will definitely like this information - there are 4 different options to choose from!

For instance, people traveling <strong>from Saigon can expect a 5 - 7 hours drive</strong>, depending on the train company and number of stops.

<a href="https://www.seat61.com/Vietnam.htm"><strong>Here you can check the train tickets and available options!</strong></a>

<em>As we already mentioned, there are four different options:</em>
<ol>
 	<li><strong>a regular hard seat</strong> - skip this one since you'll be sitting on a wooden bench and it's pretty tough to do it for 7 hours. It's not worth a few dollars you're going to save.</li>
 	<li><strong>a regular soft seat</strong> - that is the best bang for the buck since the seats are pretty comfortable and reminds of European trains. Also, you can adjust the seats so the sleeping is possible.</li>
 	<li><strong>hard bed in 6 bunks cabin</strong> - a thin and comfortable mattress shared with 5 other people. It's extremely comfortable and makes your journey easier.</li>
 	<li><strong>hard bed in 4 bunks cabin</strong> - same as the option above, but you're sharing it with 3 other people.</li>
</ol>
The price depends on the option and company you choose, but usually, it ranges<strong> from 15$ to hard seat to $40 for 4-bunk hard bed</strong>. Once you arrive at the train station, depending on the place you're staying, the taxi price to Ninh Chu Beach is around <strong>170,000 VND</strong>. You can always bargain a bit, and don't forget to use a GPS while driving in a taxi!

<strong>Don't want to get scammed in Vietnam? </strong><a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/scams-in-vietnam"><strong>Here are the 36 most common scams you can experience in Vietnam!</strong></a>
<h2><strong>By Plane</strong></h2>
Most travelers set their foot to Vietnam via three major international airports - Hanoi, Da Nang or Saigon. Either airport you choose, you can get a connecting domestic flight to the <strong>nearest airport in Cam Ranh</strong> (<strong>about 1-hour drive from Phan Rang</strong>). Cam Ranh airport is sometimes listed as Nha Trang, so be careful to ask for the information to not miss the flight or even a place.

Once you landed at the airport, there will be a handful of taxi drivers offering you a drive. The whole drive is about 1 hour and it costs around <strong>700,000 VND</strong>. Another, more convenient option is to hire a shuttle or private driver. It's a bit more costly if you're an individual, but for people who're traveling in the pack, this might be the perfect option!
<h2><strong>By Motorbike/Road</strong></h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4283" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.phan-rang-by-motorbike.jpg" alt="On the way to Phan Rang" width="987" height="740" /> <em>Many adventurers decide to explore the beauty of Vietnam by riding a motorbike. If you're one of them then you have three main routes to reach Phan Rang:</em>
<ol>
 	<li><strong>Nha Trang (north):</strong> If you're driving from Nha Trang, there are few roads you can take. A less scenic, more dangerous and faster QL1 is one option. The second option is driving from Nha Trang to Cam Rang taking a scenic coastal <strong>DT6571</strong>, and then taking a <strong>short QL1 drive until DT702</strong> which will provide you with stunning views and will lead you all the way to Phan Rang. The whole route is from 100 - 130 km long (depending on the route you take) and it will take you up to three hours.</li>
 	<li><strong>Da Lat (west):</strong> If you're starting from Da Lat, just take <strong>QL20 that will eventually become QL27</strong> and you will get directly to Phan Rang. The whole route is 110 km and it takes about three hours to complete.</li>
 	<li><strong>Mui Ne (south):</strong> From Mui Ne take <strong>DT716, then DT716B that will eventually connect to QL1</strong>. Be careful with DT716 since the police blockade is usually stopping tourists at DT716 between red and white sand dunes. There is a detour you can do to avoid the blockade and it's highly advisable to go around. The whole route is about 130 km and it takes around 3 hours to arrive at Phan Rang.</li>
</ol>

<div class="image_description">Instead of taking DT716, head over to Phan Thiet and take DT715 instead. That way, you will avoid corrupt police around white and red sand dunes.</div>
<h2><strong>Getting Around Phan Rang</strong></h2>
The most convenient option to explore this chilled place is by driving a motorbike. There are few scenic routes outside the town along with many natural wonders around. Also, the coastal road is around so what could be better than renting a motorbike? The prices for daily rental for scooter/semi-automatic <strong>starts at 100,000 VND/day</strong>.

There are some places where you can rent bigger motorbikes like Honda CRF150 that are suitable for offroad drives.

<em>If you're not confident in your driving skills, you can always count on taxies and local drivers:</em>

<strong>Mai Linh:</strong> (068) 3898 989

<strong>Sun Taxi:</strong> (068) 385 8585

<strong>Taxi Asia:</strong> (068) 3535 3535

		<Excerpt>Everyone talks about Nha Trang being ruined by Russian tourists, but no one talks about amazing snorkeling in Nha Trang! Head to Nha Trang for adventure!</Excerpt>

		<Categories><![CDATA[Vietnam>Destinations>South Vietnam]]></Categories>
		<Content><![CDATA[Nha Trang is without the doubt one of the most attractive beach city in Vietnam. The chances are when you're talking with someone about  Nha Trang you will hear <strong><em>'Don't go there, it's filled with Russians!'</em></strong>. We heard it many times, but we always explore places and experience things despite negative experiences and perspectives of other people. We do admit that almost every place has the menu on Russian and Vietnamese which is a great sign what's going on there. Also, there are many Russian tourists around, it's a fact, but not enough to skip this beautiful place!

<em><strong>Did you know that Nha Trang and its surrounding islands lie on coral reefs where marine life is so alive and diverse that it's hard to believe you're in Vietnamese waters?</strong></em>

When you have a combination of crystal clear waters and coral reef, the first thing that comes to our mind is dipping in a new adventure - snorkeling in Nha Trang and surrounding islands! If you don't like the busy bustle of the city, that's fine, head over to calm and clear waters of the surrounding area.

<em>Let's talk more about Nha Trang snorkeling and why it's so special!</em>
<h2><strong>When is the Best Time for Snorkeling in Nha Trang?</strong></h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4330" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.snorkeling-in-nha-trang.jpg" alt="Snorkeling in clear waters" width="1044" height="668" /> Nha Trang is located on the southern coast of Vietnam which means the city goes through two main seasons - low and high season. The weather and especially snorkeling conditions hugely depend on the season you're visiting Nha Trang. The best snorkeling months in Nha Trang are without any questions - <strong>April to October</strong>.

If you have a chance to visit during July or August, you'll be greeted with amazing sunny weather, combined with a bit of wind and extremely good visibility in the water. On a good day during the peak season, you can e<strong>xpect visibility of 15 - 20 meters which is crazy good</strong>! The worst time to do snorkeling is definitely <strong>between December to the beginning of March</strong>.

There are still some tours operating and you might be able to hop on a tour, but don't expect great water conditions and visibility.

<script async defer src="https://widget.getyourguide.com/v2/widget.js"></script>

Anyway, the sea around Nha Trang is extremely diverse, so while snorkeling you can expect to see all kinds of interesting sea creatures including putter fish, butterflyfish, moray eels, and beautiful corals all around you! Don't have the expectation of stumbling upon sharks, turtles or rays in these waters! We must say that for some people it's a disappointment, while for some a huge relief (Lovel knows what are we talking about here)!

<strong>Thinking of <a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/phan-rang-kitesurfing">kitesurfing in Phan Rang</a> which is just 2 hours from Nha Trang?</strong>
<div class="single_post_info_box"><i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle fa-2x"></i> <strong>Best time to go:</strong> Anywhere between April and October. July and August are the best months to be around!<br>
<strong>Worst time to go:</strong> From mid-December to the beginning of March!</div>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Snorkeling Sites for Unforgettable Experience</strong></h2>
Luckily, snorkeling sites in Nha Trang are extremely close to the city and there are many tours operating in the area, so if you're looking to snorkel in clear waters with diverse marine life, the high possibility is that you're heading to Hon Mun marine protected area. During the peak season, this snorkeling site becomes filled with tourists and boats which still makes a good experience.

<em>T</em><em>he only problem is that we're talking about the protected maritime area, but the flocks of boats and littering that goes with it make it a bit questionable.</em>
<h3><strong>Hon Ong or Whale Island</strong></h3>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4340" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.Hon-Ong.jpg" alt="Hon Ong island" width="968" height="640" /> When it comes to snorkeling in Nha Trang, the majority of people experience a stunning Hon Mun Marine Area and surrounding islands, but not so many people go a bit north from the city to stunning Whale Island or Hon Ong. The island is located a bit outside the city, about <strong>100 km northern</strong> and it's a quiet escape from all the bustle and noise of the city.

The island sits at Van Phong Bay and it provides its visitors with turquoise waters and untouched nature. There are few resorts where you can relax while enjoying the island vibe.

<iframe style="border: 0;" src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d7785.937838914125!2d109.39448484577684!3d12.650042532521635!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x3170053efe2180e3%3A0xe8b178bafd55f14d!2sHon+Ong!5e0!3m2!1sen!2s!4v1553488198411" width="600" height="450" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>

Snorkeling along with many other water activities like diving and kayaking is very popular around the waters of the island. The good thing is that the waters aren't filled with flocks of boats and tours since we couldn't find any tour that goes directly from Nha Trang.

There are few tours, especially from resorts who are organizing snorkeling on Whale Island and it usually costs about <strong>60 - 100k VND per day</strong>.
<h3><strong>Hon Mun</strong></h3>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4341" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.Hon-Mun.jpg" alt="Hon Mun island" width="1131" height="601" /> Located in a protected marine area just <strong>45 minutes away from the city by boat</strong>, Hon Mun is the most popular snorkeling site in Nha Trang. There are countless tour companies operating in the waters, so you can choose between so many options. In a protected area, there are at least <strong>300 different kinds of corals and more than a thousand species of fish</strong>.

You can stumble upon moray eel, butterflyfish, putter fish and many others. If you're looking to swim with reef sharks or rays, don't expect it since there are not residing in these waters.

<iframe style="border: 0;" src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d3900.2092854997795!2d109.30028835045454!3d12.166150135288042!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x317063b8a9c9e44b%3A0xc6f470ef9527e3ce!2sHon+Mun+Marine+Protected+Area!5e0!3m2!1sen!2s!4v1553488231270" width="600" height="450" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>

The waters are very clear and you can even see the bottom from the boat. The coral reef is so colorful and lively which will provide you with an amazing experience! Listen to your instructor since the waters there are a bit deeper than usual, ranging <strong>from 10 - 25 meters</strong>!
<h3><strong>Hon Lao or Monkey Island</strong></h3>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4342" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.Hon-Lao.jpg" alt="Hon Lao island" width="975" height="642" /> A bit underrated island located just off the coast of Nha Trang in Nha Phu lagoon is the perfect spot for snorkeling! The island is usually called Monkey island since it's a <strong>natural habitat to more than 1,000 monkeys</strong>.

Many travelers choose this one for snorkeling because <strong>not so deep waters (3 - 5 meters)</strong>, a very clear sea and so colorful coral reefs with all kinds of sea life living around. It's such a stunning place to go snorkeling!

<iframe style="border: 0;" src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d3897.340350701974!2d109.21219640045574!3d12.36011918130125!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x31706993797c9a83%3A0xa74ecc401f50f0e0!2zaMOybiBMYW8!5e0!3m2!1sen!2s!4v1553488254239" width="600" height="450" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>
<h2><strong>Amazing Snorkeling Tour in Nha Trang with Vietnam Active</strong></h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4331" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.hon-mun-island.jpg" alt="Vietnam Active in Hon Mun island" width="981" height="795" /> Nha Trang is a very popular and world-wide recognized place for water activities. The reason is a beautiful coast with many islands and peninsulas around that are surrounded by coral reef and crystal clear waters. It's not a surprise that there are countless tour companies that offer diving or snorkeling activities. We can recommend a very professional and passionate company that operates in Nha Trang called <strong>Vietnam Active</strong>.

They have an office in Nha Trang and offer all kind of adventure water activities including scuba diving, free diving and snorkeling. If you decide to go on tour with this company, expect waking up early since they <strong>start picking up people around the city at 7 am</strong>. The final destination is Hon Hun Marine Park that is about 45 minutes away by boat from the harbor.

They usually change the snorkeling sites depending on the weather conditions and visibility, but in total, you can expect to visit two snorkeling sites. At the first site on the eastern side of the island, expect to <strong>spend about 1.5 hours of snorkeling</strong>.

Even if you're not experienced or outside the form, don't worry as they have an instructor on the boat who can assist you in water, teach you a technique and give you valuable tips for snorkeling. The great thing about this tour is that people have <strong>free drinks (coffee, tea, water) as well as a diverse lunch included</strong>.

The lunch is usually a buffet with meat, cheese, eggs and vegetables which goes very good after a session of snorkeling. After the lunch, the boat drives to another site which is about 15 minutes west from the first site where you jump in the crystal clear waters and enjoy the biodiversity of life in the sea. You can expect to be <strong>back at your accommodation around 2 pm</strong>.
<div class="single_post_info_box"><i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle fa-2x"></i> <strong>Disclaimer:</strong> We're not affiliated by a tour company and we're not getting any money by promoting them. It's just a professional company that makes people satisfied and we're always happy to recommend you companies like Vietnam Active!</div>

<h2><b>#1 Cruise Bai Tu Long Bay </b></h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4367" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.bao-tu-long-bay.jpg" alt="Bao Tu Long Bay from above" width="1337" height="714" /> Ha Long Bay is a world-class attraction and definitely the most famous place to visit in Vietnam. But all those Instagram photos have resulted in a deluge of tourists crowding the bay, which is only likely to continue with the recent opening of an international airport. So if you're looking for an alternative to Ha Long Bay that comes without the crowds, consider <a href="https://travellemming.com/bai-tu-long-bay-cruises/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cruising Bai Tu Long Bay</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> instead. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This nearby bay is still part of the same UNESCO protected area and has similarly impressive limestone karsts that jut out of the tranquil bay. But because only a handful of boat operators have a license to operate here, you'll be able to experience this bay in tranquility and peace! Looking to avoid touristic crowds in Ha Long Bay? Check out <a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/halong-bay-vietnam">how to climb Bai Tho mountain</a>!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"> Spend your days kayaking through the impressive rock formations, swimming in the refreshing waters of the bay, or visiting floating villages and caves. And spend your nights fishing for squid or just relaxing and enjoying the views of the stars (without blaring music from dozens of nearby party boats!). </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This amazing experience was contributed by <a href="https://travellemming.com/">TravelLemming</a>. You can follow his journey on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/travellemming">Instagram</a>! </span>
<h2><b>#2 Ba Na Hills and Golden Bridge</b></h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4366" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.bana-hills-golden-bridge.jpg" alt="Golden Bridge at Bana Hills" width="1256" height="723" /> Everyone who has visited Vietnam in recent years will have heard of Ba Na Hills and the Golden Bridge<span style="font-weight: 400;"> near Da Nang. If you have not and are planning to visit Vietnam then you should seriously consider including this awesome place to your travel itinerary. There are a couple of good reasons why Ba Na Hills is so special. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">First of all, cable-car which takes you to this fantasy world holds a world record for being the </span>highest and longest non-stop cable-car in the WOLRD<span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the views during the ride are absolutely stunning. Golden Bridge is a relatively recent addition to this fantasy and entertainment park but it has quickly earned the love of travelers due to its unique looks. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The bridge which is seemingly made of gold is supported by two massive hands. For this reason, some even call it Gods Hands Bridge. However, Ba Na Hills is not just about the cable-car ride to the bridge. There is a whole </span>fantasy and entertainment world<span style="font-weight: 400;"> built high up in the mountains which is where all the fun happens. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Visitors are free to enjoy a number of rides, video games, performances and other activities the coolest being a mountain cart ride.

<h2><b>#3 Ho Thuy Thien - Abandoned Waterpark Near Hue</b></h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4365" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.abandoned-waterpark-hue.jpg" alt="Abandoned waterpark near Hue" width="1111" height="685" /> Hue is a city in central Vietnam, being the country’s capital from 1802 to 1945 there is plenty of history <span style="font-weight: 400;">take in as you walk the ancient and busy streets. But Hue is also home to a forgotten dragon. Ho Thuy Tien is an <a href="https://horizonunknown.com/abandoned-water-park-vietnam/">abandoned water theme park</a> that sits around a 20-minute drive from downtown </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hue. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Being so close to a busy city you would think the neglected water park would see many adventure-seeking </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">tourists – but that isn’t the case. This dragon sits at one end of the small lake, on top of a building that once housed crocodiles. While the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">crocodiles have moved on, the dragon has been left to decay with graffiti-covered scales and broken </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">glass all around.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"> There are other things to see as you drive around the bumpy and derelict footpath. An auditorium is left in </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ruins as weeds flourish and peeling paint from water slides gives a lingering eerie vibe. To add to the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">random attraction, there’s a space simulator in one corner of the park. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Since its closure shortly after opening in 2004, Ho Thuy Tien is a unique place to visit and a memorable part of the ancient city of Hue. </span>

<h2><b>#4 Mai Chau</b></h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4373" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.mai-chau-vietnam.jpg" alt="Cycling around stunning Mai Chau" width="1158" height="765" /> The scenic valley of <a href="https://karolinapatryk.com/11-best-mai-chau-travel-tips/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mai Chau</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which is surrounded by towering cliffs and verdant rice fields, is the perfect escape from the mayhem and noise of Hanoi. A four-hour bus ride from My Dinh bus station in Hanoi, your first glimpse of this beautiful village will be at the stopover point on Thung Khe Pass where you can have a cup of green tea while munching on some grilled corn and sweet potato. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In Mai Chau, it is recommended to plan a homestay in one of the villages, Lac Village being the most popular, as it will be a great opportunity to observe rural life in Northern Vietnam. Rent a bicycle and take a relaxing ride through the area or head to the Pu Luong Nature Reserve, which is well-known for its stunning hiking trails and waterfalls. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Visit Thac Bo Temple and the caves and grottos around the area. While in Mai Chau, do what the locals do. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Try cooking your rice in bamboo (Com Lam) and have it with a bit of wild boar. If you don't fancy any meat, then have it with their coconut and sesame topping. The fragrance of the bamboo and banana leaf makes eating rice a whole different experience. </span>

<h2><b>#5 Overnight Train from Hanoi to Da Nang</b></h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4374" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.overnight-train-hanoi-da-nang.jpg" alt="Overnight train from Hanoi to Da Nang" width="1022" height="762" /> To be honest, there were lots of research before our trip as to whether we should take the <a href="https://www.hilltribetravels.com/overnight-train-from-hanoi-to-danang/">overnight train from Hanoi to Da Nang</a>! There were so many mixed reviews talking about mice and cockroaches, loud and obnoxious people running up and down the corridors, and doors being opened in the middle of the night!

We booked a four-bed soft berth cabin for our family of 4 and we had an awesome experience. Catching the overnight train is definitely one of our best memories of traveling in Vietnam. This is definitely not 5-star train travel though. I think if you are used to this you will need to lower your expectations – there is no dining car or private bathrooms, wifi or meals provided etc, and if you don’t book all four beds you will be sharing with strangers.

There are some items you should bring with you on your train trip in Vietnam. Bring your own snacks and breakfast (or you can buy noodles etc from the trolley carts), wipes, toilet paper and a silk sleeping bag. There was also drinking water at each end of the carriage, so just bring your water bottles.

Overall, we can highly recommend catching the overnight train in Vietnam as a great experience. From the rolling and rocking of the train to the awesome scenery it is a really great way to travel.

<h2><b>#6 Phu Quoc Cable Car</b></h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4375" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.phu-quoc-cable-car.jpg" alt="Cable car in Phu Quoc" width="1200" height="763" /> Phu Quoc is a beautiful island just off Vietnam’s south coast. It’s ringed by incredible beaches and is an amazing place to visit for a relaxing beach break. It’s also home to the<a href="https://templesandtreehouses.com/phu-quoc-cable-car-to-pineapple-island-the-longest-cable-car-ride-in-the-world/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">world’s longest cable car ride</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which soars over the ocean to nearby Pineapple Island. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The views from the cable car are absolutely incredible. You can look down and see the turquoise sea, green islands and fishing boats below. The water is so clear that you can literally see the shadows of the boats on the bottom of the ocean bed. The beach at Pineapple Island is beautiful, although in my opinion no more so than Phu Quoc’s Long Beach and Bai Sao. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">But the round trip cable car ride to get there felt to me like an experience I’ll never forget! </span>

<h2><b>#7 Hai Van Pass on Motorbike</b></h2>

Driving through lush green fields overlooking Danang Bay it is clear to see where the pass gets its reputation. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the road is in excellent condition, the drivers should remain alert and rather stop more frequently to take in the views rather than trying to combine it with driving. Once you get used to the road and the turns, crossing Hai Van Pass on a motorbike becomes pure fun! Thinking of traveling around Vietnam by motorbike? </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Check out our <a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/hanoi-to-saigon">complete motorbike trip around Vietnam</a>! Traveling from Hue to Danang (or Hoi An) or the other way around, you can make a whole day out of riding over this “Ocean cloud pass”. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the popular stops along the way is the Elephant Springs in Bach Ma National Park where you can swim in the crystal-clear azure colored spring waters. Make sure to also stop for a swim and a delicious seafood lunch at the scenic Lang Co beach. </span>

<h2><b>#8 Ha Long Bay Cruise</b></h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4371" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.halong-bay-cruise.jpg" alt="Halong Bay Cruise" width="1110" height="738" /> Located in the province of Quang Ninh in Northern Vietnam, Ha Long Bay literally means <em>“descending dragon”</em>. Its picturesque seascape is decorated by over a thousand limestone karsts and islets. Declared as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1994, what a better way to explore Ha Long Bay than to indulge yourself in a relaxing cruise?

Aboard a traditional, wooden boat, a full-day cruise would be enough for you to marvel in its impressive beauty. Fill your senses by just finding a nice spot at the boat’s deck. For the most part, you’ll cruise the waters. But your Ha Long Bay tour can be more interesting by visiting at least one of its <span style="font-weight: 400;">limestone caves and grottoes like Thien Cung, Dau Go, and Sung Sot.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"> These maybe some of the enchanting caves you’ll ever see because apart from showcasing astonishing stalactites and stalagmites, the caves are well maintained and even adorned with natural and artificial lights. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://travelhabeat.com/vietnam-ha-long-bay-full-day-cruise/">Cruising Ha Long Bay</a> is really a refreshing, therapeutic escape from the busy streets of the city. Indeed, no visit to Vietnam is complete without experiencing it.</span>

<h2><b>#9 Enjoying Local Food of Hue</b></h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4368" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.bun-bo-hue.jpg" alt="Bowl of Bun Bo Hue" width="1023" height="759" /> One highlight that is often overlooked when visiting the imperial capital of Vietnam, is eating the wonderfully <span style="font-weight: 400;">original food</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that Hue is famous for. The imperial rulers used to enjoy large banquets that unfolded over hours, which required the development of a range of dishes to keep both the kings and their wives satisfied during the long affairs. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Using local produce, chefs developed smaller petite dishes, tasty vegetarian options, fiery soups, and seafood dishes from produce caught from the Perfume River, just to name a few. However, trying to eat your way through the entire range original Hue food would be an impossible task in one visit, so here are a few “must-try” dishes for your visit. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Bun Bo Hue, probably the most well-known dish from Hue, is a beef noodle soup that is fiery and a mainstay breakfast dish for locals and tourists alike. Want to know more about the culinary center of Vietnam? </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Head over to <a href="https://theroamingfork.com/hue-food-what-to-eat-in-hue/">must-try food while traveling around Hue</a>! Stalls selling Com Hen, a combination of rice, local clams, peanuts, and a mix of other ingredients, are everywhere, as are small restaurants dedicated to Nem Lui, sausages made from pork and cooked on lemongrass skewers, then wrapped in rice paper with an assortment of pickled vegetables and slices of the local green.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"> A few other dishes worth seeking out are Banh Khoa, the smaller and thicker version of the Vietnamese classic Banh Xeo, Banh Beo, the small rice flour cakes topped with dried shrimp and pork crackling, and the popular street food snacks of Banh Ep and Banh Trang Trung. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If your time is short, there is a well-known local restaurant called Hanh, that offers a set menu, giving diners a chance to experience many of the unique flavors and textures of Hue food. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Are you craving for some <a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/vietnamese-street-food"><strong>Vietnamese street food</strong></a>? Don't worry as Hue has loads of street food vendors offering delicious Vietnamese food choices. </span>

<h2><b>#10 Water Puppet Show in Hanoi</b></h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4378" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.water-puppet-show-hanoi.jpg" alt="Water puppet show in Hanoi" width="1071" height="658" /> Watching a water puppet performance is one of the cultural highlights you must experience in Vietnam. The art of water puppetry originated in the 11<span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> century, in the villages of Northern Vietnam. These festivals were originally held by the villagers to entertain themselves when the rice fields would flood. The flooded rice paddies acted as the stage with the water is a symbolic link to the rice harvest. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, modern water puppetry is performed in a pool, where the water acts as the stage. The puppeteers stand behind a decorated split-bamboo screen and control the puppets using long bamboo rods. Water hides the puppet strings and puppeteer movements improve the musical and vocal acoustics and provides a shimmering lighting effect. The stories enacted are a reference to ancient Vietnamese folktales. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Traditional musical instruments and songs accompany these shows. The best place to experience this is Thang Long Water Puppet Theatre, located in Hanoi near the Hoan Kiem Lake. There are multiple shows throughout the day and ticket prices cost 100,000 VND. Because of the demand, it is better to book early especially to get a seat in the first few rows.Sit further away and you won’t be able to catch much of the action! </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, you can buy puppets as souvenirs from the theatre as well as from nearby shops. This is definitely a must for your Vietnam trip. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">F</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">or more highlights from Hanoi, you can <a href="https://twoflashpackers.com/2018/07/22/48-hours-in-hanoi/">check our 2-day guide</a>! </span>

<h2><b>#11 Trekking in Sapa</b></h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4377" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.trekking-sapa-1.jpg" alt="Stunning views around Sapa" width="1024" height="757" /> Over the course of multiple trips to Vietnam, we have fallen in love with the northern province of Lao Cai. Most tourists that visit Lao Cai head to the town of Sapa which sits above the beautiful Muong Hoa Valley. Sapa is famous for its stunning landscape, vibrant handwoven textiles, and the local ethnic tribes; the H'mong, Dai, and Dao.

The highlight of your trip will be <a href="https://wanderingwheatleys.com/sapa-vietnam-trekking-guide/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">trekking in Sapa</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> through steep terraced rice fields and waving to the people in these small villages while they tend to their crops or go about their daily chores. If you really want to get a feel for the local life, make sure you spend at least one night at a homestay in one of the quaint villages. You'll be treated to dinner by the host family and probably wind up drinking more than a few shots of homemade rice wine.   </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">No trip to Sapa is complete without taking a ride on the cable car to the top of Fansipan Mountain, the highest peak in Southeast Asia. From the top of the mountain, you'll be able to look north across the patchwork of rice fields in the valley stretching all the way to China! </span>

<h2><b>#12 Exploring Cao Dai Temple</b></h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4369" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.cao-dai-temple.jpg" alt="Praying at Cao Dai temple" width="1142" height="755" /> Caodaism is a monotheistic religion that was established in the southern city of Tây Ninh in 1926. Its followers promote peace, unity and tolerance and believe that all religions are essentially the same. A mix of Asian and Western influences can be seen in religion. Its saints include Sun Yat Sen, Julius Caesar and Victor Hugo.

Like many Buddhists in Vietnam, Caodai followers practice at least <a href="https://www.thenomadicvegan.com/vegan-vietnam-tour-package/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">part-time vegetarianism</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The Great Divine Temple, which is the main temple of the Cao Dai faith, lies about 90 kilometers from Ho Chi Minh City and can be visited on a day trip. Ceremonies involving chanting, music, prayer and incense burning are held four times a day, at 6 am, noon, 6 pm and midnight. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Visitors are welcome to watch and take photos from the upstairs galleries. You must wear long pants or a skirt that covers your knees. The temple is rich in symbolism, the most important symbol is the Divine Eye. Priests dress in red, blue or yellow gowns, while followers dress in white gowns. When they kneel together in prayer, it's a beautiful spectacle when viewed from up above. </span>

<h2><b>#13 Lantern Festival in Hoi An</b></h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4372" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.hoi-an-lantern-festival.jpg" alt="Lantern festival Hoi An" width="1150" height="761" /> In Hoi An, a sleepy beach town and UNESCO World Heritage site along the eastern coastline of Vietnam, the monthly full moon is celebrated by placing lit lanterns down the river in the evening. By nightfall, the river is full of hundreds of lantern-strewn boats and colorful floating lanterns, twinkling in the distance.

The riverside can be a bit chaotic in the evening, with thousands of visitors and vendors vying for your attention, so for a more peaceful experience, I recommend floating down the river, past the revelry, in a <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">sampan </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">boat, to admire the lights and the scenery from afar. For more travel inspiration check out <a href="https://uprootedtraveler.com/">Uprootedtraveler - a travel blog for vegans</a>. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you don’t happen to be in town during the full moon, not to worry- Hoi An’s lanterns are so popular that you can find them twinkling along the riverfront on pretty much any given night. If floating lanterns aren’t your thing, I’d recommend alternatively celebrating the full moon by a nearby pagoda, where monks hold candlelit ceremonies in the evening, perfumed by incense and the sweet night air. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">   </span>

<h2><strong>#14 Learning About Local Lifestyle in English Speaking Cafe</strong></h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4415" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.english-speaking-cafe.jpg" alt="Connecting with locals in English speaking cafe" width="1153" height="770" /> My highlight of 6 months living in Vietnam is definitely to volunteer in an English Speaking Coffee Shop in Da Nang where I stayed for three months. If you don’t have so much time it’s okay to just go there for an evening. In Vietnam, there are many English coffee shops where students go to improve their English. For foreigners, it’s an amazing opportunity to meet locals and learn more about Vietnamese culture.

Right on the first day, I was invited by a local tour guide for Vietnamese people who wanted to improve his English. He showed me hidden places in Da Nang and its surrounding area. Almost every day I met new amazing people who invited me to hang out with them.

It gave me the opportunity to learn a lot about the Vietnamese culture, its lovely people and how they live. In 2 weeks I had a chance to try delicious local dishes, explore the most beautiful spots around Da Nang, how to drive a motorbike, singing karaoke and even got invited to a Vietnamese wedding.

If you really want to learn about Vietnam you should not miss the change to visit an English Speaking Coffee Shop where you can meet locals and really learn about Vietnam. These experiences showed me a true Vietnam and I decided to put my energy to give back to people.

		<Content><![CDATA[Are you looking to get out of the city bustle and enjoy your time in beautiful nature? Once you're done exploring or getting bored in Da Nang, head to Son Tra Peninsula that features wide windy roads, pagodas, hidden beaches, hiking trails, and breathtaking viewpoints! The peninsula sits just a few kilometers from the city center, and it's a perfect getaway if you are looking for a relaxing day filled with activities and adventure!

No matter where you're staying in Da Nang, the chances are you'll always see a beautiful white Buddha statue overlooking the city from the peninsula. Although Son Tra Peninsula is a massive area with many hidden treasures, the majority of travelers just scratch a few stunning places around while not knowing about other secret places.

I've been living in Da Nang for the past 14 months and had a chance to thoroughly explore every corner of Son Tra Peninsula or how tourists like to call it; Monkey Mountain.
<h2><strong>How to Get to Son Tra Peninsula (Scooters Prohibited)</strong></h2>
Getting to the peninsula is pretty straightforward. You need to <strong>reach the main beach (My Khe), </strong>and from there, it's hard not to notice a massive white Lady Buddha statue.

Basically, just follow the main beach road in the north direction (<strong>Vo Nguyen Giap that turns into Hoang Sa as you drive north</strong>). The best way to explore Son Tra is by <strong>driving a manual/semi-auto motorbike</strong>. If you're not feeling comfortable to drive in Vietnam, you can always book a motorbike tour with professional tour guides who will show you beautiful and hidden spots.

Anyway, by choosing to book a tour you're losing quite a lot of freedom as the driver has to follow the schedule, and by doing it, you'll probably miss many off-the-beaten-track places. Many backpackers in the city are exploring Son Tra, so connect with them in hostels or Facebook groups and figure out together the best solutions.

Renting a motorbike in Da Nang is very affordable, and it costs <strong>around 100,000 VND for a scooter for a whole day</strong>.

<del>I suggest getting a manual or semi-automatic bike since some roads are very steep, and you might experience a tough time to get your scooter up there, especially if you're two on the bike!</del>

<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>UPDATE November 2019: <a href="https://e.vnexpress.net/news/travel/places/da-nang-prohibits-scooters-on-peninsula-following-spate-of-accidents-3997623.html">Automatic scooters are prohibited</a></strong> to go to Son Tra Peninsula since there were many fatal accidents due to brake failure. Currently, you can't get to Son Tra without a permit that you can get at one of three security gates (free of cost). Visitors can enjoy Son Tra from 7:30 am to 7 pm daily.</span>

If you're looking to get your bike, there are things you should look at when <a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/buy-motorbike-in-vietnam">buying a motorbike in Vietnam</a>, so if you don't have any mechanic skills, be careful!

<h2><strong>Man Thai Village</strong></h2>
<p id="wjWGKbF"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5545 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5dd79e785491e.jpg" alt="Man Thai Village, Da Nang" width="998" height="742" /></p>
Just at the beginning of Son Tra, there is a tiny fishermen village called Man Thai. A few years back, it was an authentic fishermen village, but now, due to <a href="https://uni-tuebingen.de/fakultaeten/mathematisch-naturwissenschaftliche-fakultaet/fachbereiche/geowissenschaften/arbeitsgruppen/geographie/forschungsbereich/geoinformatik-gis/arbeitsgruppe/aktuelle-projekte/rapid-planning/example-urbanization-danang/">rapid development</a>, it is another part of the city. If you follow the beach road Hoang Sa in the direction of Son Tra, you will see a colorful fleet of coracle boats anchored in a tiny bay. The best way to experience the lifestyle of locals is by <strong>getting there around 6 am</strong>.

At that time, the village is so lively and vibrant as locals sell fresh seafood and prepare the boats for the sea. Every time, it amazes me how active Vietnamese people are. On the way there, you will stumble upon older and younger people running, doing a morning workout, stretching, and dancing a funny dance called Duong Sinh.

<strong>Expats in Da Nang: </strong>Looking to relocate and start a new life in Da Nang. Read our <a href="https://vietnamchronicles.com/living-in-da-nang">cost breakdown of living in Da Nang</a>. Few places sell morning snacks like Banh Mi and a <a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/vietnamese-drip-coffee-guide">strong cup of Vietnamese coffee</a>. Also, on the beach, you can sit in a beach chair while enjoying your morning snack and watching the sunrise.

That's my favorite way to start my morning!
<h2><strong>Green Lake</strong></h2>
From Man Thai village, people usually head straight to Linh Ung pagoda, completely missing a stunning lake on the way - Green Lake. Once you're on the road to Linh Ung pagoda and when the road slowly starts to ascend, one the left-hand-side, you'll be greeted with the views of the stunning lake. Just park your motorbike there (few people will be there, and you can securely leave the bike for 10,000 VND or just go to the lake with your bike), and you are ready for exploration.

During March - June, the water is crystal clear, and the lake looks green since the bottom has much grass, which is a natural habitat for many fish species! There are few places where you can jump and swim, as well as a small campsite where you can raise a tent to finish off your adventure!

<em>Did you know that almost every wedding photo session isn't complete without a shot at Green Lake?</em> Don't miss it!

Especially not on a hot day where the lake will provide you with the best refreshment you can think of!
<h2><strong>Linh Ung Pagoda</strong></h2>
<p id="xfWiEvu"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5544 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5dd79e0f5758a.jpg" alt="Linh Ung Pagoda Son Tra Peninsula" width="995" height="743" /></p>
Once you're done with swimming and taking stunning photos at Green Lake, it's time to visit famous Linh Ung pagoda! That place is by far the most-visited attraction on the peninsula, so be very strategic about your arrival. Go there just <strong>after the sunrise since there are not many tourists around, and you can experience Buddhist prayers and rituals</strong>.

The worst time is definitely around 11 am - 6 pm! Avoid full-moon days and other holidays as locals flock there, and it can be tough to even walk around without bumping into people! The place is the complex of a few pagodas and temples where people pray and perform rituals. Also, <strong>Lady Buddha that is 67 meters tall</strong> stays in the middle of the complex, protecting Da Nang from wind and storms.

Just walking around the complex will provide you with some stunning views over the city.

<strong>Plan your itinerary: </strong>Check out our <a href="https://vietnamchronicles.com/3-days-in-da-nang">72 hours Da Nang itinerary</a> and have fun. An interesting fact is that local fishermen built lady Buddha statue as they believed her presence protects them and gives them luck when they head to the sea.

<em><strong>The entrance is free of charge, and you can leave a donation in the parking zone.</strong></em>
<div class="single_post_info_box"><i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle fa-2x"></i> As it's a Buddhist temple, be sure that you have some level of respect by wearing long pants and sleeves. Vietnamese people aren't rigorous when it comes to clothing compared to Thailand or Myanmar. Just cover your knees and shoulders, and you'll be fine.</div>
<h2><strong>Secret Beach #1</strong></h2>
<p id="PoYNxvS"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5543 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5dd79d07a95d3.jpg" alt="Secluded sandy beach on Son Tra" width="1169" height="707" /></p>
Once you continue driving from Linh Ung pagoda further, you will reach a hut with small and improvised parking. There is a woman who asks <strong>10,000 VND during the day and 35,000 VND during the night</strong> to take care of your bike. From the parking spot, just follow the narrow path that leads to the secluded beach. Friendly locals who're camping or drinking, spend their afternoons at the beach.

During the day, the only people you'll see are few fishermen who're catching the fish from the rocks around (very impressive to observe the dedication and patience of these people).

<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>UPDATE November 2019: </strong>Last time when I went there, my mirrors from the bike were stolen in front of the women. When we explained the situation, she became very aggressive as she was trying to prove we've arrived without the mirrors. We showed her our GoPro footage, but she disagreed and called us 'filthy tourists'. Also, she charges for beach maintenance, which is fine, but once you arrive at the beach, you'll be greeted with vast and smelly piles of trash everywhere. </span>
<h2><strong>Bai Da</strong></h2>
<em>By this time, you might feel a bit hungry and in need to refill your energy. What would be the better way than enjoying the local seafood on the beach in a small hut overlooking Da Nang?</em> Bai Da is the ideal spot for that!

If you continue to drive further from Bai Nam beach, you will reach a parking spot where you can park (free) while enjoying local delicacies. There is a small beach with rocks and a few human-made bridges connecting the rocks. It's a perfect way to spend your afternoon before heading to the next location!
<h2><strong>Ghenh Bang</strong></h2>
Once you're back on the main road, just continue heading east, and you'll be greeted by the most stunning views Son Tra peninsula has to offer! There is a stunning pass overlooking the outer part of the peninsula while giving you breathtaking views of the open sea. You can park your bike there, sit a bit and relax on the cliffs! The views are really spectacular.

If you continue a bit further, you will stumble upon a <strong>small parking lot where taxi drivers park their cars</strong>.

Go there and park your bike (no cost). There is a short and ascending hiking trail that leads you to the rocky beach. You will need to pass through some trees, so be sure to have long sleeves and proper shoes as it gets slippery on some parts. After 20 minutes, you'll reach Ghenh Banh - a small and secluded beach featuring stunning rocks and colorful underwater life.

You can swim and snorkel! Climbing up is relatively easy compared to going down, and once you reach the parking lot, you can sit and order a traditional

Vietnamese coffee or tea and enjoy the passion of taxi drivers while playing a card game.
<h2><strong>Banyan Tree</strong></h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4465" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.banyan-tree-son-tra.jpg" alt="Beautiful Banyan Tree" width="970" height="641" /> Once you're done with your hike to Ghenh Banh and back on the road, after a minute, you'll reach the next crossroad. Take the right turn and just follow the rarely marked trail. It's a very narrow road that goes further up the mountain. The condition of the road isn't the best and there is always some traffic, so be careful when driving as there were few accidents reported recently.

After a few minutes, there will be a small fork where you take the right turn (it's marked). Just follow the road, and you'll reach a Banyan tree that is said to be <strong>around 1,000 years old</strong>. That area is the natural habitat of endangered monkey species called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red-shanked_douc">Red Shanked Douc</a>.

That species live around Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam, but <strong>most of them (around 200) lives in the forest of Son Tra Peninsula</strong>. Although, you have to be very lucky to see that beautiful monkey around it. When we were exploring Monkey Mountain, we only heard them, but never saw them. The diameter of the tree is around 20 meters, and some branches connect to the ground as it serves as the root.

It's very amazing just to take a seat and experience this beautiful creation of Mother Earth. You can park the bike on the road free of any cost.
<div class="single_post_info_box"><i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle fa-2x"></i> The tree has a historical value as, during the Vietnam war (or how locals call it, an American war), Vietnamese soldiers used the tree as the shelter.</div>
<h2><strong>Mui Nghe</strong></h2>
<p id="UQhOqqr"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5542 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5dd79c40155df.jpg" alt="Mui Nghe" width="1168" height="872" /></p>
Once you're done wandering around a Banyan tree, just continue driving on the road until you reach a dead end. You park the motorbike there, and from there, you'll see a small path through the jungle. Be ready for <strong>about 30-minutes hike</strong> that leads to the end of Son Tra peninsula - Mui Nghe.

The literal translation of the name is a<em> 'Horn of the Buffalo'.</em> There is a very cool place where you can set a campsite and enjoy the sunrise and stunning sunset falling over Da Nang city. If you continue your hike, you will eventually get to the sea where you can swim and snorkel. The water made a small lake between the cliffs where you can swim in cold and turquoise waters.

Be careful, though, as we saw many jellyfish in the 'lake'!
<h2><strong>Tien Sa Lighthouse</strong></h2>
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-4475 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.tien-sa-lighthouse.jpg" alt="Son Tra Peninsula Tien Sa Lighthouse" width="1192" height="785" /> On the northeast part of Son Tra, there is a tiny Tien Sa lighthouse. The lighthouse is only 16 meters tall, and it helps in navigating the boat traffic between Hue city to Da Nang port. Once you reach the lighthouse there will be a security guy who requests <strong>20,000 VND for climbing the lighthouse</strong> and get panorama view over the sea and mountains of Son Tra.

It's relatively easy to reach the lighthouse if you follow the main Hoang Sa road. The way is the same as you're going to the Banyan tree, but at the fork (you've turned right to reach Banyan tree), just continue driving.
<h2><strong>Bai Cat Vang Beach</strong></h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4457" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.Bai-Cat-Vang.jpg" alt="Bai Cat Vang beach" width="1425" height="683" /> Now when you have so many places and information on how to reach those places on the eastern part of the Son Tra peninsula, it's time to explore the western part - a more secluded part featuring secluded beaches. Bai Cat Vang is the first off-the-beaten-path beach on the way. Park your motorbike at the beginning of a narrow path and walk for about 5 minutes until you reach a small beach hidden in a bay.

It's a sandy beach with a few rocks where you can chill or even set up your tent. While we were there, we stumbled upon local fishermen who were coming from the sea. Also, you can enjoy snorkeling or swimming in crystal clear waters in a tiny bay. As tourism is booming in the city, it takes effect on Son Tra too.

Bai Cat Vang has a local resort that looks empty during offseason, but as locals say, it becomes hectic during the season (April - September). We went there in March, and we stumbled upon a few local families with kids.

During the summer, there are many activities you can take part in, like <strong>snorkeling, kayaking, scuba diving, building a campsite with a massive fire, and much more</strong> When planning your trip to Da Nang, be sure to take the season in a planning process.

Read about the <a href="https://vietnamchronicles.com/best-time-to-visit-da-nang">best seasons to visit Da Nang</a> and have the best possible time.
<h2><strong>Bai Da Den </strong></h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4458" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.Bai-Da-Den-.jpg" alt="Bai Da Den" width="1185" height="827" /> When you're done with exploring Bai Cat Vang beach, you should follow a tiny path towards your bike. When you pick the motorcycle, just continue about 100 meters further, and you will reach a small parking spot where you can leave the bike. From there, you will notice a small and narrow path going down to the Bai Da Den beach. The beach is rocky, and many cliffs make it ideal for snorkeling or kayaking.

Also, there is a camping spot just on the cliffs that gives you beautiful views so far away from the bustle of the busy Da Nang city.
<div class="single_post_info_box"><i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle fa-2x"></i> Whenever we visited the place, we always stumbled upon friendly locals who were camping. The biggest problem with camping there is that locals aren't aware so much about the littering, so they leave every piece of trash behind them. Please don't do it!</div>
<h2><strong>Ban Co Peak</strong></h2>
<img class="wp-image-5541 size-full aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5dd79b99501a9.jpg" alt="Ban Co Peak Son Tra Peninsula" width="1173" height="873" />
<div class="image_description">Ban Co Peak is the highest point of Son Tra Peninsula and it provides people with stunning views over the whole city.</div>
Situated in the middle of the Son Tra Peninsula, Ban Co is the tallest peak of the peninsula where you'll be greeted with stunning views over the jungle on one side and a whole city on the other side. As the summit is 693 meters above sea level, the clouds are cutting through it, which gives you an incredible experience and feeling that you're literally in the clouds.

Once you reach the peak, you can park your motorbike on the <strong>parking lot that costs 5,000 VND/bike, </strong>and from there, you have to climb a bit to reach the top. Also, at the parking spot, you can order cold drinks like tea or coffee, but the best is to bring some fruits or beverages with you (some people enjoy a picnic there).

The views are breathtaking, but you should time your trip since it's a very touristic place and crowds can kill the vibe. Arguably, the best time to visit Ban Co is around the sunrise. At the top, there is a De Thich statue in front of the chessboard. Interestingly, De Thich is playing by himself.

A <a href="https://english.thesaigontimes.vn/42085/Huge-chess-board-on-top-of-Son-Tra-Mountain.html">legend goes</a> that he was playing with another deity while he flew down to the beach as he was distracted by beautiful fairies. He lost the game, and out of anger, kicked the chessboard to the sea. People made the statue in a credit of another deity who was waiting for him and planning the next move.

<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>UPDATE November 2019: </strong>Last time when we climbed to Ban Co peak, they've furnished the trail to the top. Right now, you have concrete stairs that make a final climb accessible to anyone. </span>

		<Content><![CDATA[Working remotely became a huge trend and opportunity for professionals to set their office anywhere and experience the beauty of the world while working on the projects. South East Asia is slowly becoming the major hub of digital nomads, so Vietnam is getting on that list pretty fast. Da Nang is one of the most developed coastal cities in central Vietnam that is known for a small, but fast-growing community of digital nomads.

The city is very clean, people are relaxed, the beach is just next to the city center, the infrastructure is great, the international airport is just in the city center and the internet is fast! What more to ask for as a digital nomad looking for a place to be productive? There are many cafes popping up each day that are suitable for the work - delicious Vietnamese coffee, ergonomic seats and fast internet (also, the staff doesn't mind if you stay there for few hours!).

Although there are few coworking spaces in Da Nang where you can buy passes and work in the specifically designed office, we prefer working in small and cozy local cafes.

<strong><em>When working on this list of the best cafe places in Da Nang to make your work done, we had in mind the next specifications:</em></strong>
<ul>
 	<li>How fast and reliable is the internet?</li>
 	<li>Comfortable chairs and tables</li>
 	<li>Enough power outlets for charging your laptop and other technology</li>
 	<li>Quality of coffee/other drinks</li>
 	<li>Prices</li>
 	<li>Location</li>
 	<li>Atmosphere in the coffee shop</li>
</ul>
<em>Let's check out our favorite working cafes in Da Nang!</em>
<h2><strong>Allen Coffee</strong></h2>
<img class="wp-image-4502 size-full aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.allen-coffee-1.jpg" alt="Allen coffee" width="1113" height="828" />
<div class="image_description">Photo was taken by <a href="https://www.facebook.com/allen.coffeesv/">Allen Coffee</a></div>
By far our favorite cafe in Da Nang where you can do some serious work done! It's located just on the banks of Han River in Hai Chau district and their menu selection, friendly staff and countless tables to set up your office is simply amazing. The cafe has a few floors, but due to lack of customers, only the first two floors are opened.

There is a terrace where you can work, surrounded by trees and birds that can help you in focusing on the work. Also, almost every table has a power outlet which is a huge benefit for people who needs to do some work- Coffee is very delicious and we're usually drinking their <strong>Ca Phe Sua Saigon (one of the best we had a chance to try in the city!)</strong>.

The cafe is a bit crowded during the morning hours since locals flock in to socialize and enjoy their morning coffee before hitting the work.

Anyway, there are so many seats where you set up your office so it won't be a problem, but sometimes in these hours, the noise is a bit annoying. <img class="wp-image-4503 size-full aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.allen-coffee-2.jpg" alt="Allen coffee intierior" width="810" height="728" />
<div class="image_description">Photo was taken by <a href="https://www.facebook.com/allen.coffeesv/">Allen Coffee</a></div>
The Internet is stable and pretty fast. We were uploading many videos on YouTube with ultra-fast speed there. Prices range from <strong>30,000 - 60,000 VND for all drinks</strong>, but the staff will never mind if you're sitting there even for 8 hours! Also, they are so friendly and they usually bring us a huge pot of delicious and potent tea free of cost.

The parking site is just across the cafe where you can park your bike for free.

<h2><strong>Mua Coffee Shop</strong></h2>
<img class="wp-image-4512 size-full aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.mua-coffee-2.jpg" alt="Mua coffee interior" width="1101" height="733" />
<div class="image_description">Photo was taken by <a href="https://www.facebook.com/muacoffeedn/">Mua Coffee Shop</a></div>
If you're looking for a modern and cozy place around An Thuong area then you might find your next favorite place where you can do some serious work. Mua Cafe is an amazing place that is designed for students and remote workers in mind. Whenever you come, you'll meet other digital nomads working on their project as well as dozens of students learning in a quiet area.

The cafe has three floors with few terraces. On the first floor, there are small tables and couches which isn't the best for working, but you can still do some work there. When you climb up to a second floor, there are just a few couches and many big tables with fans and AC where you can really do some great work.

At that floor, there is a quiet area with the AC where you have about 10 tables with very comfortable chairs and many power outlets. That's the place where we usually do some serious work. Also, on the second floor, there are few small balconies with tiny chairs overlooking the street, so if that's your preferred place to work then you'll have an amazing time.

A third floor is a small rooftop with few tables and chairs. People usually have meetings there and it's very hot to work during the day while during the night is loud and crowded. <img class="wp-image-4511 size-full aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.mua-coffee.jpg" alt="Being productive in Mua coffee" width="628" height="639" />
<div class="image_description">Photo was taken by <a href="https://www.facebook.com/muacoffeedn/">Mua Coffee Shop</a></div>
They have a huge selection of coffee and other fresh beverages like smoothies and juices (for juice, they, unfortunately, use syrup, not fresh fruit). Their prices range <strong>from 25,000 - 50,000 VND</strong>. Also, the internet is very fast and reliable. They have few access points, so if you have trouble with one, you can easily switch to another one.

Another great thing we love about Mua Cafe is that they give you a glass bottle of water every time you go there, so you won't be dehydrated!

<h2><strong>Moon Coffee</strong></h2>
<img class="wp-image-4509 size-full aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.moon-coffee.jpg" alt="Moon coffee interior" width="1255" height="816" />
<div class="image_description">Photo was taken by <a href="https://www.facebook.com/MooNCoffeeDaNang/">Moon Coffee</a></div>
Are you a type of digital nomad who enjoys stunning views while working? If so, then Moon Cafe is probably the cafe to go! It's located just next to a Dragon Bridge in Hai Chau district near Nguyen Van Linh street that connects the airport with the beach. There are two floors, one airconditioned with chilled music and another on the rooftop which is more for the meetings than working.

Also, on the first floor that is a small terrace where you can set up your office and have a direct view of Dragon Bridge. The only downside of the terrace is the noise since it's just on one of the busiest streets in Da Nang (a few more power outlets would be more than appreciated too!).

Inside, there are about 8 tables with power outlets where you can sit for a long period of time and focus on the work. There are few couches so if you prefer something like that, you'll love it.

Also, there is a huge part where you can sit on the floor and set up your laptop on a small table. We usually love to work there as that's the perfect way to do a bit of stretching as you're working. <img class="wp-image-4510 size-full aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.moon-coffee-2.jpg" alt="Moon coffee balcony" width="1257" height="835" />
<div class="image_description">Photo was taken by <a href="https://www.facebook.com/MooNCoffeeDaNang/">Moon Coffee</a></div>
Coffee and their menu selection is huge and the prices aren't too huge. The price ranges from 25,000 - 60,000 for their beverages. We really love their milk coffee! Also, the internet is quite fast and reliable. We uploaded huge files while working there without any problems or interruptions. Staff usually don't mind if you stay there for many hours so you can just focus on your work!

<h2><strong>Six on Six Cafe</strong></h2>

<div class="image_description">Photo was taken by <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sixonsixcafe/">Six on Six coffee</a></div>
Probably every digital nomad or who wants to become one heard for Six on Six Cafe. Whenever we come there, it's filled with like-minded people who're focusing on their projects. There is a small community of expats who are working every day together, so if you're looking to connect and get into the community in Da Nang, head over to this one.

The location is a bit outside the city, but it's just next to the beach which is perfect when you have to take a break from work. Once you set your feet to the cafe, you'll be greeted with a tiny garden area where you can set up your office. There are many tables outside as well inside in the air-conditioned area.

The Internet is probably one of the fastest and most reliable we had a chance to work on in Da Nang. Their coffee and beverage selection is huge! If you're a coffee lover then you will definitely fall in love with this cafe since they have professional baristas who know a lot about coffee. You can also learn a lot from them as they are very passionate about their job!

That's one of the best places to enjoy an iconic Vietnamese coffee since they have many ways of preparation including cold brew, Aeropress, french press and pour over. Another interesting fact about their coffee is that they use 100% Arabica beans from the coffee farms around Da Lat.

<em>Did you know that the majority of Vietnamese coffee is made from cheaper and easier to produce Robusta beans?</em>

<strong>Learn more about Vietnamese coffee: </strong><a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/vietnamese-drip-coffee-guide">A guide to traditional Vietnamese coffee</a>

Probably the best thing about Six on Six is that they have a menu with healthy meals and fresh fruit smoothies!

That's perfect for people who plan to spend a whole day grinding on the project without having to lose time to eat. Simply refill your energy whenever and keep your creative flows in high levels! Prices range from <strong>30,000 - 120,000 VND</strong>. While it's not the cheapest place, you'll probably won't mind to pay a bit extra!

<h2><strong>43 Factory Coffee</strong></h2>
<img class="wp-image-4500 size-full aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.43-factory.jpg" alt="43 factory" width="1234" height="826" />
<div class="image_description">Photo was taken by <a href="https://www.facebook.com/43factory.coffee/">43 Factory Coffee</a></div>
43 Factory is one of the places where you'll have a chance to try only the best coffee beans in Vietnam, but also from around the world. The interior, but also exterior definitely stand out. Once you get there, the place is all in the glass with a modern design from outside including a small garden and few pools with water.

When you get inside, you'll immediately get hit by coffee aroma! That's the best thing ever if you're a coffee addict and at the same time a digital nomad looking for the place to get the job done!

Did you know Da Nang is the most livable Vietnamese city? Read more why <a href="https://dailytravelstories.com/living-in-da-nang/">living in Da Nang</a> is AWESOME.

In the middle of the cafe, there is a bar with few baristas that are very knowledgeable about the coffee beans, ways of preparation and even a history of coffee.

We had a great time just talking with them and getting as much information as possible about the coffee.

When it comes to working, they have long tables with very comfortable seats that is ideal for long-sessions of focused work. They have many different options when it comes to coffee including a regular espresso, french press, syphon (which is btw. very interesting process to watch!), pour over as well as non-caffeine options.

You can also enjoy various selection of tea, juices from the fresh fruits and even craft beer! <img class="wp-image-4501 size-full aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.43-factory-2.jpg" alt="Working at 43 factory coffee" width="1147" height="805" />
<div class="image_description">Photo was taken by <a href="https://www.facebook.com/43factory.coffee/">43 Factory Coffee</a></div>
There are many power outlets as the coffee shop is specifically designed with the work in mind. The prices are a bit on the higher side and you should expect to pay from <strong>50,000 - 100,000 VND for a coffee</strong>.

The Internet is really fast and we never had any problems while working there. Staff is super friendly and helpful, and the chilled music in the background makes 43 Factory and ideal cafe for digital nomads in Da Nang!

Joy Box Coffee was a random and pleasant discovery for us! Are you a type of nomad who is looking for extraordinary design of cafe place? Well, there is hardly a coffee shop in Da Nang that can beat this one! The whole design and coffee shop is based in and around <strong>4 ship containers</strong>. Inside ship containers, there are cozy seats and tables with many power outlets.

Outside you can enjoy a breeze and a tiny garden with a fish pond while working on the project. They have a huge selection of coffee and sweet food like cakes and croissants. We really enjoyed their <strong>coconut coffee, so definitely try it while going there!</strong> Staff is extremely friendly and helpful, so you won't have any problems while working for long hours there.

The Internet is very reliable and fast with a few different access points, so expect no problems while working there.

<div class="image_description">Photo was taken by <a href="https://www.facebook.com/miacoffeeroasterydanang/">Mia Coffee Roastery</a></div>
As the name tells, Mia Coffee is a cozy cafe that roasts their own coffee beans that originate from mountainous Da Lat in the south of Vietnam. The cafe is very spacious with many seats and tables and they are definitely after a simplistic design - we love it! The wood and brick inter. The place has two floors with many tables where you can set up your office and also almost every table is just next to a power outlet.

Another memorable thing about this cafe is definitely a pleasant smell of roasted coffee, especially when you walk through the doors for the first time!

Staff is extremely friendly and welcoming and also they have <strong>western dishes on the menu like pasta and bacon/cheese</strong>. The Internet is extremely fast and reliable while the location is just in the city center!

<div class="image_description">Photo was taken by <a href="https://www.facebook.com/DanangSouvenirs/">Da Nang Souvenirs and Coffee</a></div>
At first glance, Souvenirs in the name of the cafe probably doesn't look attractive for doing some serious work. We thought the same, but we gave a try to this amazing cafe and we were blown away by its interior design and coziness. This one is definitely a digital nomad friendly cafe! Cafe has many seats and it's just located near Han River in the city center.

There are many tables with wooden chairs, few couches and one the second floor, there is a quiet and comfortable room where you can do serious work. Tables are very wide and power outlets are everywhere (hope you have a long cable).

As this is a souvenir shop too, try to <strong>avoid early morning hours</strong> as that's the time the tourists usually flock in to get <a href="https://vietnamchronicles.com/souvenirs-from-vietnam">traditional souvenirs</a> and enjoy their time with a delicious and potent coffee. They serve a traditional Vietnamese coffee as well as Italian coffee, fresh smoothies and juices, cocktails and beer. The prices are regular for the center area.

<h2><strong>Golem Cafe</strong></h2>

<div class="image_description">Photo was taken by <a href="https://www.facebook.com/golemdanang/">Golem Cafe</a></div>
Located just next to Da Nang Cathedral, Golem cafe is one of our favorite work cafes in Da Nang! The interior design is simply amazing and it will keep your creative flow in check, even during the whole day of working. They have a small garden area in front with few tables suitable for work. If you're looking to work outside, be sure that you charged your laptop since they lack power outlets outside.

There is another, an air-conditioned area which is ideal to get some work done, just next to the garden that provides you with the views over the garden.

The tables are very huge and the seats are comfortable for long sessions of work. Also, there is a vast amount of power outlets. There is an upper floor where you can sit and chill the outdoor vibe while doing the work since there are many tables equipped with power outlets. <img class="wp-image-4506 size-full aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.golem-coffee-1.jpg" alt="Golem coffee" width="1109" height="816" />
<div class="image_description">Photo was taken by <a href="https://www.facebook.com/golemdanang/">Golem Cafe</a></div>
Their coffee is simply amazing and you can pick between many options. We really enjoyed their coconut coffee and latte. Also, another very interesting thing about Golem cafe is that they have a huge selection of board games! What would be a better way to finish your working day than playing some of your favorite board games with your friends or team?

We haven't experienced any problems when it comes to the internet and the staff was extremely friendly! Definitely a place where you can do some serious work done!

From the street, it's a bit hard to say it's a suitable place for getting the job done, but head over the second floor and you'll be positively surprised. The white and black interior with a lot of natural lighting is a very refreshing and motivating for working there.

There are many tables with very comfortable seats where you can sit for hours and do some work, but the only problem is that the power outlets are a bit far away from tables, so don't mind bringing an extension cord with you.

Coffee is very tasty and there are many options when it comes to bakery delicacies. We worked there a few times without any problems with the internet.

Also, the staff is extremely friendly and nice. They always check if you have enough water or tea and give you refill all the time.

		<Content><![CDATA[So you had a fantastic time exploring the beauties of Vietnam with a motorbike and now you're thinking about your next adventure? Well, why not to bring your bike to a neighbor Laos and experience untouched nature and off-the-beaten-track while having complete freedom?

<em>Many travelers don't know there is a possibility to cross the border from Vietnam to Laos by your motorbike! It's possible and usually (depending on the border) hustle free!</em> Anyway, you have to be very picky when it comes to crossing point as some borders are impossible to cross/bribe required!

Also, immigration officers tend to change the rules from day to day, so always have a backup plan. Antonio crossed the Lao Bao / Dansavanh border, spent one-month driving and living in Laos and returned to Vietnam through the same border. All without a single hustle! Not a single officer asked him about the motorbike!

<em><strong>Here's everything you have to know about bringing your motorbike to Laos and back!</strong></em>
<h2><strong>Getting to Lao Bao From Da Nang/Hoi An/Hue</strong></h2>
We already wrote a huge guide on doing a <a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/visa-run-lao-bao">visa run from Da Nang to Lao Bao</a> where we shared a complete and detailed route. Head over it to get more information. I started the journey in Da Nang and stayed one night in sleepy Dong Ha before heading to Lao Bao border. Dong Ha is a perfect stop since it's just <strong>around 70 km away from Lao Bao border</strong> and the historic road provides you with stunning views over mountains, rivers and passes.

<em>Once you arrive at Lao Bao / Dansavanh border with your motorbike, here's what you have to do to cross to Laos:</em>
<h2><strong>Required Documents For Crossing to Laos By Motorbike</strong></h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4546" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20181128_143828.jpg" alt="Documents for border crossing with the motorbike" width="4160" height="3120" /> <em>There is some documentation you have to obtain before going to the border. Also, it depends on your plans - do you plan to go back to Vietnam after exploring Laos?</em> I had a plan to spend a month in Laos while driving my beloved motorbike and then head back to Vietnam. To be able to do it, you have to <strong>obtain an invitation letter for Vietnam beforehand (original letter with the red stamp on it!)</strong>.

The immigration officer will ask you about your plans and invitation letter. After a short check, you'll get an exit stamp and you're ready to get a visa sticker for Laos. The process is effortless for getting Laos visa for a month.

You go to the counter for Visa on Arrival, fill the form, provide <strong>one passport photo and $35 for a visa</strong> (it depends on the nationality and ranges from $32 - $45).
<div class="single_post_info_box"><i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle fa-2x"></i> My advice is to always have dollars with you since the officers will give you an inflated exchange rate for any other currency! Be careful with dollars since they check the condition of the bills, so be sure that you don't have ripped bills since they will reject taking them!</div>
<em><strong>To summarize, here are documents you'll need:</strong></em>
<ul>
 	<li>passport photo</li>
 	<li>filled Laos VoA form</li>
 	<li>original invitation letter for Vietnam (in case you're planning to go back to Vietnam)</li>
 	<li>$32 - $45 for Laos visa</li>
 	<li>passport with more than 4 empty pages</li>
 	<li>blue card for your bike (no one asked me about any document related to my bike)</li>
</ul>
If you don't plan to visit Laos, but you're heading to Lao Bao just to do a visa run, head over to our detailed guide on <a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/visa-run-vietnam"><strong>doing a visa run from Vietnam</strong></a> that will answer all your questions related to infamous visa run.
<h2><strong>Detailed Process of Crossing the Border With Your Motorbike</strong></h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4548" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.56422341_2313763188943884_6659745653175877632_n.jpg" alt="Process of bringing motorbike from Vietnam to Laos" width="1560" height="1170" /> Alright, so you're approaching Lao Bao border and you're getting all nervous overthinking about everything. Don't worry! Keep reading as I'm going to share all the information that will make your crossing to Laos with a motorbike effortless! <em>Here you go:</em>
<ul>
 	<li>Once you approach Lao Bao border, you'll stumble upon a building complex and the parking lot (on a Vietnam side). You can ignore that complex entirely since that's the place where you make a Vietnamese visa and getting an exit stamp from Laos. You don't need any of that, so you can slowly drive your bike further.</li>
 	<li>Soon, you'll approach another building complex that is on the Laos side. You have to park your motorbike there and go straight to 'Vietnam Exit Formalities' house where the officer will check your current Vietnamese visa and the invitation letter for your return. Also, he might ask you about your plans to Laos. I was extremely opened and shared my complete plan and told him about the motorbike (some people suggested me not to talk about the motorcycle). Anyway, after a minute, he gave me an exit stamp from Vietnam.</li>
 	<li>After you get the exit stamp, you head over to Laos VoA counter where you have to fill a visa form, provide a passport photo, $35 for a sticker and you're ready to go. The whole process of getting a Laos visa will take about 10 minutes. No one asked me there about the motorbike, but they do ask me where do I go and what I plan to do.</li>
 	<li>The next step is getting back to your motorbike and bringing it to Laos. I left the backpacks and all the stuff tied to my bike while I was doing the process and everything was still there.</li>
 	<li>The most important is that you don't drive a bike around the border, but push it. Just push it next to 'Vietnam Exit Formalities' and there will be a Vietnamese and Laos officer who will check your paper. They tend to be very interested and positive with a bit of knowledge of English. They didn't ask anything about the motorbike/or any paper.</li>
 	<li>When they checked my papers, I was about to turn on the bike, but the officer told me to push further. You push for the next 20 meters until you reach the next checkpoint. Smiling Laos officers greeted me with a loud<em><strong> 'Sabaidee'</strong></em>, check my passport and visa, didn't ask for a single document for the bike and told me you're ready to go!</li>
</ul>
<strong>That's it! After one hour of the whole process, I was officially in Laos with my motorbike.</strong> No questions or papers asked for the motorbike. It was relatively easy to pass the border. Also, few other travelers shared the same story.
<div class="single_post_info_box"><i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle fa-2x"></i> There is a building that says <em>'Vehicle Import'</em> on the border. Don't go there! Officers will tell you to go there if you have a bigger bike. I was told that you should go there if you have a motorcycle bigger than 175cc.</div>
<h2><strong>Best Place to Exchange Your Money</strong></h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4547" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.lao-kip.jpg" alt="Exchange your money to Lao Kip at the border" width="917" height="642" /> Alright, so the first struggle for me, after getting my motorbike to Laos, was where to get Lao Kip. There will be few women around the border offering you to exchange the money, but I just gave them friendly no. They live off of exchange rate, so I guess the rate won't be in your favor. Literally on the border (parallel to the place where you push your bike) are two banks - <strong>Lao Viet Bank and Phongsavanh Bank</strong>.

Go over there and you'll get a fair exchange rate for your VND or USD. They even change Euros to Lao Kip. I did a mistake and missed that place without any Lao Kip in my pocket. I ran out of fuel just in a small town with three banks. After checking two banks, they said to me the same, <em>'Go to another bank, they change'</em>. The last bank said no too, but I explained to them that I was in a bad situation and the manager went to the car and came back with a huge amount of Kips.

They gave me an outstanding exchange rate and I had a wallet full of Lao Kip. Be sure not to be an ignorant traveler and always check the current exchange rates, so you know if you have a good or bad deal. The banks or other exchange places are usually for negotiating about the rate if it's not official. I advise you to use XE Exchange, a lightweight and cool app that will keep you updated on the current rates.

Also, we wrote about other <a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/mobile-apps-vietnam">handy mobile apps for your motorbike trip</a>!
<h2><strong>Other Helpful Tips for the Road</strong></h2>
<ul>
 	<li>I advise you to start your journey early and get to the border before the lunch break. I was told by many people to avoid 11 am - 2 pm, and despite that, I literally arrived at 12 am. There was no other tourist, and I had the process done so fast. Officers were very friendly and helpful too.</li>
 	<li>Change your money to Lao Kip in the bank on the border to avoid the awkward situations that can happen later on the road.</li>
 	<li>Try to reach Savannakhet or Thakhek before dark since there are no street lights on the road. Don't worry, the road from Dansavanh all the way to Savannakhet is the best road I've ever driven on in SEA. I was cruising at 75 - 80 km/h with my Honda Wave all the time. Also, there is almost no one on the road, so it's very easy to drive.</li>
 	<li>Be careful of cows and goats on the road!</li>
 	<li>Cover your skin with long sleeves since Laos is extremely hot! It was so hot during my visit in early March!</li>
 	<li>Always have enough water with you. If you run out of the water, you can always ask on the gas station and people will fill your water bottle free of any cost.</li>
 	<li>There are few small villages on the way to Savannakhet, so be sure that you always fill your bike once you're in the town as the gas stations are pretty far away from each other.</li>
 	<li>If you have a modified bike or you don't have two mirrors, fix it and change it! Police there doesn't care if you're a foreigner or local. They are pretty notorious for bribes and they see you like the opportunity to earn some money. I had a modified exhaust and spent a few hours in the police station after police caught me.</li>
 	<li>Maintaining and fixing the bike in Laos is easy since there are many local mechanics on the road. It's a bit more expensive than Vietnam but still affordable and mechanics know how to get the job done. A regular price for an oil change is 30k LK. Don't pay more!</li>
</ul>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>For the end, there are some pictures from the journey to Savannakhet. :)</strong></h3>

		<Content><![CDATA[Planning to visit the biggest and most developed city in Vietnam - Ho Chi Minh City (formerly known as Saigon)? Well, is there anything better than getting your hands on some weed and enjoying the smoke while exploring the beautiful sights the city has to offer, educating yourself about Vietnamese history or taking a part in probably the best nightlife in Vietnam?

There are many things to do, especially when it comes to nightlife! Many backpackers and travelers who're looking for crazy nights head down to Saigon. Weed, alcohol and other things are very available in the city, so you shouldn't experience any problems when getting some cannabis!

<em><strong>Keep reading as we're going to provide you with a complete guide on getting and smoking weed in Saigon!</strong></em>
<div class="single_post_info_box"><i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle fa-2x"></i> <strong>Disclaimer:</strong> This article was not written to promote the use of illegal substances, but to make their consumption as safe as possible. You should you decide to break the law on your own accord. VietnamChronicles does not condone the consumption of cannabis. Be safe and responsible!</div>
<h2><strong>Cannabis Laws in Saigon</strong></h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4562" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.cannabis-laws-in-saigon.jpg" alt="Cannabis laws in Vietnam" width="1280" height="853" /> Laws related to cannabis are the same in Saigon as in the rest of the country. Businesses are popping up each day and more tourists are coming to have a crazy time there. On the paper, for having just a little cannabis on you, you can serve a lifetime in a labor prison, or even get executed. Many people will advise you not to smoke any weed in Vietnam, but just keep reading and you'll get the idea how is the situation there!

Well, as a communist country, corruption levels are very high, especially among police and lower levels of government. It means that almost in any case if you get caught, the police will try to get as much money as possible from you. Please have in mind it's only applicable for getting caught while smoking and having a small stash on you.

If you get caught carrying huge quantities around, then you can expect a crazy time with police and probably the bribe won't save you! Weed scene is huge in Saigon and there are areas where you'll see expats and locals smoking and rolling openly in the middle of the road. Some places are filled with police and still, you can smell cannabis all around.

Police don't look so much concerned about the tourists, but always use your common sense and avoid smoking in public places. There is a huge possibility that if you get caught nothing will happen, but the hustle with the police is usually crazy as there is a language barrier and also, you will lose a lot of time and money just for one joint.

Be smart and smoke on secluded places to avoid it!
<h2><strong>Where to Get Weed in Saigon</strong></h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IE33_hir1c8" width="764" height="430" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>

Getting weed in Saigon is very easy and you must be very unlucky not to get your hands on some cannabis. The quality can vary a lot, but still, for the price you pay you will definitely get a certain buzz. Saigon is known for a vibrant nightlife so it's not a surprise to see many tourists and expats having the best time of their lives around the city.

Once you're walking around the streets of Saigon, you will smell cannabis here and there. Your best bet is by checking the popular backpackers' street called <em><strong>Bui Vien street</strong></em>.

The nightlife there is very vibrant and many street shops are around. Also, the bars filled with tourists are at each step, and you will definitely smell some cannabis from some of these.

You know what to do! :)

<script async defer src="https://widget.getyourguide.com/v2/widget.js"></script>

Also, on Bui Vien street, you will get approached by many taxi drivers who'd like to sell you cannabis openly on the street. Some people reported being scammed and not getting the real cannabis, so if possible, always try to check out the stuff before giving your money away. There are hundreds of ways how you can get scammed in Vietnam.

Read our <a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/scams-in-vietnam"><strong>guide on avoiding most common scams</strong></a>!

Don't forget to check the intersection between <em><strong>Pham Ngu Lao street and De Tham street</strong></em> as there will be always a few motorbike drivers chilling and offering cannabis.

We found cannabis by checking the party events where foreigners come, so it was very easy to score some cannabis there.

The best bet would be to get to know expats who're living in the city for a longer period as they probably have connections.

Also, don't forget to check party hostels around Saigon!
<h2><strong>Cannabis Prices in Saigon</strong></h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4563" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.where-to-get-cannabis-in-saigon.jpg" alt="Cannabis prices in Saigon" width="1280" height="784" /> Prices usually vary depending on the quantity, quality, and connections you have. Expats and locals usually get good prices compared to tourists as they already know people and places to go. Your best bet is to make friends with them and let them hook you up with their connection. That way, you're sure to get the best bang for your buck.

Taxi drivers will often sell you a small bag of around 3 grams for <strong>500,000 VND (around $20)</strong>, but the quality is very low. You can always negotiate the price with them and sometimes if you're lucky, you can get the same amount for half of the price. For 10 grams of low-quality domestic buds, you can expect to pay around 500,000 VND.

These buds look very bad, but the high will be decent when you put more in one joint.

The kush is popular there, but it's mainly for the tourists which means the quality isn't comparable to the kush and the prices vary from <strong>500,000 - 1,000,000 VND for a single gram</strong>.

Saigon is a very awesome city where you can do many things and enjoy a crazy nightlife. No matter which day of the week you decide to go to a party, there will be always something going on. Getting your hands on weed in Saigon is pretty easy and kind of safe, but always use your common sense. The laws are strict, but no one seems to force them, so even if you get caught, you can expect to pay a bribe that is usually around $100 or more.

Remember one thing! In Vietnam, you can always negotiate the price! Enjoy your stay in Saigon! :)

		<Content><![CDATA[Are you looking for an amazing retreat destination in the south of Vietnam? Mui Ne might be the perfect place you'd like to visit as it's located on the southern coast in the middle of the desert. It's the capital of windsurfing in Vietnam as the wind always creates huge waves that are ideal for surfing or windsurfing. Mui Ne is a popular backpacker spot with many parties going on, so if you're looking to get some weed in Mui Ne, you shouldn't be worried!

Streets are filled with cannabis and almost on every step you'll smell some cannabis, especially during the night.

<em><strong>Looking to get some weed in Mui Ne? Keep reading our guide and you'll get complete information on getting and smoking cannabis in this stunning place!</strong></em>
<div class="single_post_info_box"><i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle fa-2x"></i> <strong>Disclaimer</strong>: This article was not written to promote the use of illegal substances, but to make their consumption as safe as possible. You should you decide to break the law on your own accord. VietnamChronicles does not condone the consumption of cannabis. Be safe and responsible!</div>
<h2><strong>Cannabis Laws in Mui Ne</strong></h2>
<img class="size-full wp-image-4601 alignnone" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.laws_.jpg" alt="Always use your common sense while smoking weed in mui ne" width="997" height="744" />

Well, the laws in Vietnam are the same everywhere on the paper, but it hugely differs in the practice. On the paper, for the possession of small amounts of cannabis, you can end up in a Vietnamese prison for many years. It's important to note that it's only on the paper, as the law practice related to cannabis is totally different in Vietnam.

If you're scared of getting cannabis in Vietnam, we advise you to check our complete guide on <strong><a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/cannabis-in-vietnam">Vietnam cannabis scene</a></strong>. The country still struggles with corruption and communism, and the salaries of police officials are usually low, so they are looking for the way to supplement their salaries every day.

The most common way to do it is by getting the bribes from foreigners, but also from locals. Mui Ne is a small coastal town with many resorts and even more tourists around. It's easy to get your hands on cannabis there, but also, very easy to get stopped and searched by police. Always use your common sense and have a separate wallet just in case you'll face the police in Mui Ne.

Looking for other adventures nearby? Head over to Phan Rang that is a small city located just about 3 hours motorbike drive from Mui Ne. The city is known for its delicious food, local vibe and <strong><a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/phan-rang-kitesurfing">world's famous kitesurfing</a>.</strong> The police will usually ask you for a huge bribe in order to get out of the unpleasant situation, but believe us, you should always bargain.

They will settle with the 30% or even less of the first asking price. Although it really depends on the quantity of cannabis you had on you.

If you had more than 25 grams, then don't try to negotiate and pay the asking price as it can be seen as the distribution or selling purpose.

Just use your common sense, don't be a drunk tourist walking in the middle of the road while smoking joint and yelling on people and you'd be fine. (We saw that scene in Mui Ne quite often!)
<h2><strong>Where to Get Weed in Mui Ne</strong></h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4603" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.where_.jpg" alt="Getting weed in mui ne is extremely easy" width="1002" height="748" /> Getting cannabis in Mui Ne is very easy. You don't need to do almost anything, as the local drivers will always approach you and ask you do you want some weed. They usually hang out near ATMs, so if you can't find them, just head near the ATMs and you will have many offers. The problem is that the weed from street sellers is usually low-quality and under-quantity, so you will have a hard time to get the buzz.

Also, there are many stories of foreigners that got tea or just a grass instead of cannabis, so be careful. We were talking with few people who shared the story of a few backpackers who got snitched by the dealer who sold them cannabis to police. They paid a huge bribe and probably police and dealers are sharing it. Be careful when doing it, and never do it near your place of stay.

Mui Ne area is unfortunately known for many scams going on.

Check out the <strong><a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/scams-in-vietnam">biggest list of Vietnam scams</a> </strong>and how to avoid them. Also, if you've ever got caught by the police, here's a guide on <a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/vietnamese-police-guide"><strong>how to deal with Vietnamese police successfully</strong></a>. We bought few bags of cannabis from street dealers and the weed quality is very bad. They always ask for a big price, but you just keep lowering the price and you can get it for a very cheap price.

Also, they are very hesitant to give you the bag to take a look and smell it, but just insist on doing it and they will give it to you. They always have a cigarette pack with many bags inside, so probably some bags are filled with tea, grass or other things that can look like cannabis to the untrained eye.

The deal is always crazy as you will get the weed literally in the middle of a busy street, so be extra careful and check your surroundings always! Another better way to score some weed is by checking the <strong>Dragon Beach Club</strong>, especially during the weekends. There are always huge parties with locals and foreigners and you will always smell a lot of cannabis there.

Just keep your eyes open and ask around. You will definitely get your hands on weed pretty fast. Also, head over to backpacker hostels and ask people around/front-desk. They will usually help you to connect you with the right people.

Just don't worry! It is a very impossible mission to not get your hands on any weed in Mui Ne.
<h2><strong>Cannabis Prices in Mui Ne</strong></h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/A7J_h1p9grQ" width="764" height="430" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>

In Mui Ne, there are usually two kinds of cannabis - a Vietnamese grown and Cambodian import. Both kinds are very low-potent and won't get you the best high, but it's working a bit.

When we were smoking, the high was lasting maybe for 20 minutes and then you need to roll another one. Also, many people said they had a headache, but we didn't experience it, just crazy red eyes all the time.

When it comes to prices, on the street, dealers will usually ask you for <strong>900,000 VND for Cambodian and 600,000 VND for Vietnamese sort</strong> (a baggie of claimed 5 grams that looks like 2 grams at its best). We've got our price lowered from 600,000 VND to 250,000 VND, so always bargain and don't forget to check the bag before buying it.

The prices in the clubs and backpackers hostels are similar and on average you can expect to pay around <strong>500,000 VND for 5 grams of really low-quality cannabis.</strong>

<hr />

Mui Ne is a very interesting small town with stunning beaches and crazy huge waves. If you're into windsurfing or surfing, then you should definitely head over there. Also, there are Red and White sand dunes that look totally out of this world.

Cannabis is very easy to get and relatively safe to smoke there. Just use your common sense and don't get scammed. Enjoy your stay in Mui Ne! :)

		<Content><![CDATA[Whenever you hear about Vietnam, probably the first association is a delicious and diverse Vietnamese street food. We've been living and traveling around Vietnam for almost two years and surprisingly, in every conversation, you'll hear about delicious Vietnamese cuisine. When we think a bit about our experiences with food in Vietnam, it's not actually that surprising that people LOVE Vietnamese food. <em>Who won't fall in love with fresh, diverse, complex, and cheap food on every step?</em>

Literally, you can smell tasty food on every step and try a different cuisine every day. Another interesting fact is that cuisine drastically changes once you start to travel around the country.

We've talked with 10 bloggers and influencers who've been living or traveling around Vietnam and they shared their favorite Vietnamese traditional food.
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>10 Vietnamese Street Food You Have to Try (According to Bloggers and Influencers)</strong></h2>
<h2><strong>#1 Chuối nướng (Grilled Banana)</strong></h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4695" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.grilled-banana.jpg" alt="Grilled banana from the South Vietnam" width="1161" height="775" /> If you're walking down a street market in Vietnam and happen to catch the undeniably tantalizing smell of caramelized bananas, follow that intoxicating aroma to a vendor dishing up one of Vietnam's most delicious desserts, chuối nướng (or grilled or barbecued banana). Originating in the Mekong Delta, where bananas are plentiful, chuối nướng can be prepared two ways: either with a plain grilled banana, toasted over a fire, or, alternatively, wrapped in sticky rice and banana leaf and cooked until the rice turns a golden brown (this variety is technically called "chuối bọc nếp nướng").

Once the banana is cooked to puffy, delicious perfection, it is drowned in luscious, creamy coconut milk and dried sesame or peanuts are sprinkled on top. Served piping hot, this dish is best enjoyed when the ingredients are thoroughly mixed together, to get a full mouthfeel of the soft banana, the decadently silky coconut milk, and the savory crunch of the nutty toppings.

Although you can hunt down this dish in Hanoi and throughout the northern cities of Vietnam, chuối nướng is much more prevalent in Southern cities, like Ho Chi Minh City, Can Tho or My Tho. And the best part? Since this is pretty much exclusively served up as street food, a serving will usually set you back a whole <strong>15,000 – 20,000 VND</strong>.

<h2><strong>#2 Vịt chiên (Fried Duck)</strong></h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4694" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.fried-duck.jpg" alt="Plate of fried duck" width="1184" height="787" /> Hanoi is full of interesting, tasty and cheap street food. After sampling all of the street food that Hanoi has to offer, you should splurge on one meal - the Fried Duck at Grandma's. One of the top restaurants in Hanoi, Grandma's serves traditional North Vietnamese cuisine. One of its signature dishes is a crispy fried duck. You may have eaten duck elsewhere, but Grandma's is different. The pieces of duck are breaded and deep-fried.

Admittedly, not your healthiest meal, but tender and tasty. It comes with fried rice cakes and pickled vegetables. The fried duck <strong>costs 299,000 VND (approximately $13USD)</strong>. As we said, Grandma's Fried Duck is a splurge, but worth it. Grandma's is in the Old Quarter not far from Hoan Kiem Lake and a good place to stop on your <a href="https://travelforlifenow.com/hanoi-itinerary-5-days/"><strong>Hanoi itinerary</strong></a>.

<h2><strong>#3 Bánh đa trộn (Noodles with Fish Sausage)</strong></h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4690" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.banh-ba-tron.jpg" alt="Noodles with fish sausage" width="981" height="784" /> Hanoi's Old Quarter is full of food. Around every corner and on every street, there is fresh, local food. After getting your fill of Pho and Banh Mi, if that's even possible in Vietnam, find something a little different. Search for Bánh Đa Trộn. To put it simply, Banh Da Tron is a bowl of deliciousness. It looks like a dressed-up bowl of Phở without the broth.

To be specific, Bánh đa trộn is a bowl of noodles and chopped fish sausage patties. All of this is in a fish paste and topped with crispy strips of squid. For many people, the ingredients don't sound appetizing. Somehow, it's perfect all together. The sausage doesn't taste fishy or odd; instead, it's a unique savory flavor. The noodles complement the crunchy squid.

As always, hot sauce and chili paste is on the table. Bánh đa trộn is not a particularly typical dish but is found in a few places in Hanoi. In the Old Quarter, a few local shops that see minimal tourist traffic serve Bánh đa trộn. To my delight, I stumbled upon a family noodle shop a couple of blocks south of Pub Street. At the time, all I knew was it was good. In the end, that's all that matters.

<h2><strong>#4 Bánh mì (Sandwich)</strong></h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4692" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.banh-mi.jpg" alt="Vietnamese street food staple - banh mi" width="864" height="645" /> A bánh mì is thought of as a traditional Vietnamese sandwich, although it was initially more of a fusion dish, with strong influences from French cuisine as a result of the French colonization of Vietnam. The sandwich is made with a French baguette-style bread that is crunchy on the outside but soft and doughy on the inside.

The baguette is then filled with several different ingredients, usually some combination of vegetables, meat, fresh herbs and sauce. There are many meat-based versions of the bánh mì, but vegan versions made with tofu or with mock meat also exist and are called bánh mì chay ("chay" is the word for vegan or vegetarian food in Vietnamese).

It's a monster of a sandwich and can be very messy to eat, but that's all part of the fun! One of the best places to try a bánh mì for the first time is at Bánh Mì Phuong, a local institution in Hoi An (<a href="https://saigoneer.com/eat-drink/eat-drink-categories/saigon-food-culture/16485-hoi-an-s-banh-mi-phuong-opens-first-overseas-branch-in-seoul"><strong>opened the first store in Korea</strong></a>) that became famous for its bánh mì after Anthony Bourdain ate there and called it "a symphony in a sandwich".

The usual version is filled with meat and other animal products, but they will make a vegetarian or <a href="https://www.thenomadicvegan.com/vegan-vietnam-tour-package/"><strong>vegan version of this classic Vietnamese dish</strong></a> on request.

Special thanks to Wendy for this entry. Follow her vegan journey on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Nomadic.Vegan"><strong>Facebook</strong></a> or <a href="https://www.instagram.com/nomadic_vegan/"><strong>Instagram</strong></a>.
<h2><strong>#5 Bánh cuốn (Rice Flour Pancakes)</strong></h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4691" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.banh-cuon.jpg" alt="Rice flour pancakes" width="1020" height="706" /> Bánh cuốn, one of Vietnam's most delicious street foods, is also one of the most entertaining to watch being made. Bánh cuốn is traditionally a Northern Vietnamese dish and can be found on almost every corner in Hanoi. It's also commonly served for breakfast at <a href="https://wander-lush.org/vietnam-homestays/"><strong>homestays in Northern Vietnam</strong></a>. It consists of steamed rice flour pancakes stuffed and rolled with an excellent pork and mushroom filling. Bánh cuốn is typically served with a bowl of nước chấm dipping sauce on the side and in Hanoi, with a soft-friend egg on top (local's choice).

My favorite way to eat bánh cuốn is with cubes of chả lụa (pork sausage inflected with spices such as cinnamon) on the side. The best bánh cuốn is made fresh to order. It's a joy to watch street stall owners ladle out the rice flour batter, raising and lowering the steel lid of the steamer and peeling back the delicate pancakes.

For 'fast-food', it's quite a time-consuming and artful process. I never got tired of eating bánh cuốn when I lived in Hanoi for a year. In Vietnam's capital, you can find bánh cuốn stalls everywhere—just look for the distinctive steamer set up in the front of the stall or shop.

<h2><strong>#6 Heo sữa (Roasted Pig)</strong></h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4699" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.roasted-pig.jpg" alt="Roasted pig" width="1178" height="704" /> Most people focus on eating pho in Vietnam, and they should. Most food travelers don't know that Vietnam makes some of the best roast sucking pig in the world! A suckling pig is a young pig, which is why it is so tender. It is normally roasted over an open flame, outdoors. Each restaurant has its own special seasoning, where they often use a syringe to inject the seasoning into the pig.

The skin is usually based in coconut milk, making it super sweet and crispy. It's not easy to find suckling pig in Vietnam. It's not on a typical Vietnamese restaurant menu. Instead, it's most commonly found in countryside restaurants in small villages. The best suckling pig comes from Central Vietnam, around Hue, Danang, and in Quang Tri Province.

If you're traveling around Da Nang, apart from delicious and diverse Vietnamese street food, don't forget to explore natural heaven called <a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/son-tra-peninsula"><strong>Son Tra Peninsula</strong></a>. It's ordered by the half or whole pig and comes to the table sliced in pieces.

The pig is typically served with a little mixture of salt, pepper, chili, and lime, to spice up the meat. And, it is almost always washed down with a cold Vietnamese beer served in a glass, over ice. In a country where many dishes cost only a dollar or two, order a half pig is more of an investment, often costing the equivalent of <strong>150,000 - 300,000 VND</strong> depending on the restaurant. But, it's a great value and a must-eat traditional Vietnamese dish.

<h2><strong>#7 Phở bò (Traditional Noodle Soup from North Vietnam)</strong></h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4698" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.pho-bo.jpg" alt="Traditional noodle soup" width="974" height="643" /> Phở bò is a staple of Vietnamese cuisine. Found in restaurants, homes, and especially on small street food stalls around the country, it's a dish you simply must try when visiting Vietnam. If you are in <a href="https://myadventuresacrosstheworld.com/things-to-do-in-hanoi/"><strong>Hanoi</strong></a>, make sure to wander the narrow streets of the Old Quarter and spot where the majority of locals sit: that's bound to be a good place for pho. The soup consists of a thin broth made by cooking beef bones for several hours.

The soup is served in a large bowl with flat rice noodles, spring onions, and thin slices of raw beef which cooks with the heat of the broth. You also get a small plate with bean sprouts, mint and coriander leaves, sliced chilies, and lime to add to your taste. Pho bo is served throughout the day - though apparently Vietnamese people enjoy it most for breakfast.

You eat it with a spoon that you use for the broth, and chopsticks which you use for the noodles and all other ingredients.

<h2><strong>#8 Bún bò huế (Noodle Soup from Central Vietnam)</strong></h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4693" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.bun-bo-hue.jpg" alt="noodle soup from central Vietnam" width="865" height="647" /> The best-known dish to originate from Vietnam's imperial capital, Hue, is the delicious bowl of noodle soup, known simply as <span class="_5yl5">Bún bò huế</span>. This tasty, predominately <a href="https://theroamingfork.com/vietnamese-breakfast-dishes/"><strong>breakfast dish</strong></a>, is brought together by adding noodles (Bun) and cuts of meat, which can include beef (Bo), pork, bone marrow, small balls of prawns, and crab, and sometimes cubes of congealed pigs blood. The above ingredients are added to a rich broth, which has a complex flavor and is the backbone of the dish.

Making the broth is usually a time-consuming affair, with pork and beef bones being simmered for hours, with a combination of lemongrass, shrimp paste, pineapple, and chili, added along the way. The red tinge to the dish comes from the addition of annatto oil. The ingredients result in a soup that has a full flavor, yet is citrusy, a touch spicy, a little sweet, and with a long and pleasing aftertaste. Add more chili, lime, and herb from the table to further enhance the soup.

Despite the origins of the dish being from Hue, <span class="_5yl5">Bún bò huế</span> can be found all over the country, from Hue themed restaurants, through to carts on the side of the road. And at the cost of <strong>between 20,000 - 40,000 VND</strong>, this is a dish not be missed on your Vietnam adventures.

Special thanks to Markus for this amazing entry. Follow his journey on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/theroamingfork"><strong>Facebook</strong></a> and <strong><a href="https://www.instagram.com/theroamingforkblog/">Instagram</a></strong>.
<h2><strong>#9 Mì quảng (Delicious Noodles from Central Vietnam)</strong></h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4696" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.mi-quang.jpg" alt="Mi Quang" width="862" height="645" /> If you ask me, one of the most delicious foods I've ever tried in my life is by far Mì quảng. This mouthwatering noodle dish is a specialty from Quang Nam, which is one of the largest provinces located in the center of Vietnam. It's special because of its uniqueness. Surprisingly, its uniqueness is from its diversification in the ingredients to cook it.

Mì quảng is an excellent combination from perfect soft, chewy noodle, stewed meat (or fish, chicken…); thick and savory broth which is an extract after long stewing meat(fish, chicken) with spices; fresh mixed vegetable; peanut; and grilled rice paper.

Squeeze a piece of lime, crumble grilled rice paper, put some chili pepper and fish sauce (if you're sure you can eat spicy food combined with fish sauce) in your bowl of Mì quảng. Mix it up and you can smell the scent from endless green rice-fields, feel cool water from long streams, taste the salt from our farmers' sweat, and sweet from Vietnamese' hearts.

The bowl of delicious and mouthwatering noodles costs <strong>from 15,000 - 30,000 VND</strong>.

Special thanks to Alice for this amazing entry. Follow her journey on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/lead.mup"><strong>Facebook</strong></a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/mi_quang91/"><strong>Instagram</strong></a>.
<h2><strong>#10 Ốp la (Fried Eggs With Sausage, Meat and Bread)</strong></h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4697" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.op-la.jpg" alt="Fried eggs and sausage" width="869" height="517" /> While traveling to many countries, I tried out many different foods. Before coming to Vietnam, I never was a "breakfast guy" but living here for 8 months now, I learned to love it. My perfect morning always includes a <a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/vietnamese-drip-coffee-guide"><strong>Vietnamese traditional coffee</strong></a> and Ốp La Bộ Xúc Xic. Ốp La means fried egg, Bộ means beef and Xúc Xic is a sausage.

So it's mainly a fried egg with some pieces of beef and sausage. At my favorite place, they prepare it on a special plate of stone and mix it all together. They also add some corn, potato, and onion.

They serve crispy bread and a fresh green salad (cucumber and lettuce topped with oil). It's a pretty simple but amazing dish. Also, it never gets boring and I could eat it every day. The price of a delicious plate will cost you anywhere <strong>from 15,000 - 40,000 VND</strong>.

		<Categories><![CDATA[Vietnam>Travel Tips]]></Categories>
		<Content><![CDATA[So, you’ve been daydreaming about doing a motorbike trip in Vietnam for months and you've finally decided to book a ticket and seek the adventure there?  In the last few years, Vietnam is becoming an extremely popular destination, especially for backpackers since the prices are relatively low compared to the western world.

Many people are traveling around Vietnam on a daily basis and there is so much information on the internet on that, but in this article, I’m going to provide you with the ultimate guide for your motorbike trip in Vietnam.

<em>Find a comfortable place, brew yourself a delicious coffee, and keep reading!</em>
<h2><b>Pre-Arrival to Vietnam</b></h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4734" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.prearrival-to-vietnam.jpg" alt="Flying to Vietnam" width="1180" height="773" /> First and foremost, you have to figure out the documentation required to get into Vietnam. Depending on your home country, the process for gathering all the required documents may slightly differ. <em>Here is a list of documents you have to sort out before visiting:</em>
<h3><b>How to Arrange a Tourist/Business Visa</b></h3>
Well, Vietnam still requires a visa for the majority of countries, but it’s extremely easy to get a tourist visa for up to 3 months. The country allows visa on arrival for 150 countries, so <a href="https://www.myvietnamvisa.com/which-countries-are-eligible-vietnam-visa-arrival.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>check out the list</strong></a> to be sure what’s the process for getting a visa for your country.

To get a visa on arrival, you need to have a letter of approval that you show at the airport and they make a visa for you. There are many tourist agencies that will make a letter for a visa you want for a really small cost.

We always get a three-month tourist visa letter for $15 - $30.

We wrote a complete guide on <a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/vietnam-tourist-visa" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>getting a Vietnam tourist visa</strong></a> where you can get all the information about the process, costs, types, and exempts.
<div class="single_post_info_box"><i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle fa-2x"></i> <strong>NOTE:</strong> Be sure that you have the letter with you when coming to the airport as you may face problems getting into the plane without the letter. If you're flying into Vietnam, then you don't have to have an original letter (red stamp). It's enough to just print out the letter the agency sent to you. For land borders, it's important that you have an original letter with you.</div>
<h3><b>Getting the Cheapest Flight Ticket</b></h3>
Once you figured out your visa, it’s time to book a flight ticket. My favorite way to do it is by checking aggregator sites like <a href="https://www.skyscanner.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Skyscanner</strong></a> or <a href="https://www.cheapoair.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>CheapOair</strong></a>. They collect the cheapest tickets around the world and present them to you. Also, don't forget to check <a href="https://kiwi.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Kiwi.com</strong></a>.

<strong>NOTE: </strong>Be cautious with Kiwi since the service combines different flight companies and there is a probability they won't cover your missed flight (they also have the insurance for missed flights!). Also, don't forget to search for flight tickets in incognito mode on your browser.  The only advice for buying a flight ticket is to pick the right season.

For example, the period from July - September is known as a rainy season and that’s the time when there are not many tourists around, so tickets and other things in the country are priced a bit lower. If you’re scared that you will only experience the rain, please don’t be as the country is very long and the north mainly experiences a lot of rain, while central and southern parts of the country usually have great weather all the time.
<h3><b>Which Travel Insurance to Get?</b></h3>
Always have travel insurance as you never know what may happen on the road (advice from a guy without travel insurance who paid $500 for a simple check). Hopefully, nothing bad will happen, but you never know, especially when you’re traveling through rough terrains of Vietnam. The hospitals are very good and clean in the big cities (expect to spend a lot without insurance) but in the small towns around the countryside, the hospitals might look like you've got into a horror movie.

Countryside hospitals are usually full, the staff doesn't speak English and the cleanliness level is questionable.
<div class="single_post_info_box"><i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle fa-2x"></i> <strong>NOTE: </strong>After Antonio crashed the bike, he went to a local hospital in the countryside and he had a good experience. Doctors knew how to speak basic English and they treated him well. On the other hand, he went to an international hospital and he said the service was outstanding, but it costs a small fortune without insurance.</div>
<h3><b>International Driving License - Is It Necessary?</b></h3>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4739" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.traffic-in-vietnam.jpg" alt="Is it necessary to get international driving license in Vietnam?" width="1137" height="629" /> Before coming to the country, even if you don’t plan to travel around the country by motorbike, don't forget to get an international driver's license. There are so many stunning places around the country and experience is by far better driving on your own. Police in Vietnam is very corrupt and they usually don’t target foreigners (in the countryside), but if you have the accident and you don’t have a proper license, then the insurance won’t cover your costs.

In case you're planning to stay in Vietnam for a while, the viable option would be to get a <a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/vietnamese-driving-license" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Vietnamese driving license</strong></a>.
<h2><b>Essential Things for Your Backpack</b></h2>
Vietnam has a monsoon and tropical climate through almost a whole year, so pack light clothes if you’re planning to visit anytime except December - March. These few months are a bit colder, especially in the north, so prepare accordingly. Temperatures and stability of weather get much higher after <a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/tet-holiday-vietnam"><strong>Tet holiday</strong></a> that falls in the first week of February. Last year, from November all the way to early February, it was raining a lot in central Vietnam.

In cold months, temperatures reach 15°C but don’t get fooled as it is extremely cold because of the high humidity in the air. You will be fine, but always check the weather in the part of the country you’re planning to go.
<div class="single_post_info_box"><i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle fa-2x"></i> <strong>Friendly tip:</strong> Bring sunscreen and any other cosmetic things from your country. Sunscreen is so expensive in Vietnam, taking into account the quality. Also, it's almost impossible to find a sunscreen without whitening effect (read: some hard chemicals).</div>
Now when you have sorted out the documentation and have proper things in your backpacks, it’s time to talk a bit about the budget and transportation around Vietnam.
<h2><b>Budget &amp; Transportation Options</b></h2>
Vietnam became a very attractive country for backpackers as it is relatively cheap compared to the western world, but also, it gives a variety of options when it comes to luxury travel. No matter your style of traveling, you will definitely find what suits you in Vietnam for a reasonable price. If you’re planning to travel around the whole country in a month or a similar period, then this guide would be perfect for you as we did it, so we can share some tips with you!

Check out our detailed post where we shared all details on <a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/vietnam-on-a-budget"><strong>how much money we spent during our one-month motorbike trip</strong></a>.
<h2><b>Budget Breakdown of Our Motorbike Trip in Vietnam</b></h2>
I traveled around the whole country in 30 days driving the motorbike. That way is becoming more and more popular, especially after <a href="https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x6bvfro"><strong>Top Gear’s special episode</strong></a> where the crew did the motorbike trip around Vietnam.

Check this episode out to get an idea of what to expect during your motorbike trip around stunning Vietnam (not really! Always expect unexpectable in Vietnam).
<h3><strong>Accommodation</strong></h3>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4722" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.accommodation.jpg" alt="Accommodation in Vietnam is pretty basic, but can be luxury if you're looking for it." width="1237" height="749" /> We've traveled on a backpackers’ budget and I must say we didn’t lack anything. The majority of budget planning was related to accommodation, but sometimes we booked a more comfortable homestay or hotel to relax after a long time being on the road. Basically, for accommodation, you can expect to pay from <strong>70,000 - 150,000 VND/person</strong> for a nice and cozy hostel in a shared room.

These rooms are amazing if you’re a solo traveler as you will always meet travelers who're doing the same trip. Also, if you want privacy, but don’t have an opportunity to pay more, go for capsule hostels! If you’re traveling in a group, I advise you to always book a homestay or hostel in the 4-bed-shared room. The prices will be similar for a person, but you will have more privacy for your group.

On average, we spent about <strong>130,000 VND/person</strong> for accommodation. We really stayed everywhere; from dirty hostels all the way to very stunning private homestays. It really depends on your style of traveling how much you're going to spend. If you're on a shoestring budget, there are many backpacker's hostels with the price starting as low as <strong>40,000 VND for a bed</strong>.
<div class="single_post_info_box"><i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle fa-2x"></i> <strong>Friendly tip:</strong> Always check the user's reviews and the user's rating on the platform. Some hostels/homestays will have a great description and pictures, but when you come here, you will be disappointed with how misleading it is! Don’t make the same mistake as I did! :)</div>
<h3><strong>Food &amp; Drinks</strong></h3>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4744" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.food-in-vietnam.jpg" alt="Food in Vietnam" width="1186" height="753" /> Believe me, there is an unlimited food option starting from the diverse street food, all the way to upscale restaurants with stunning views (do it if you're looking for a spoil, but the food can't compare to street food!). On our trip, we didn’t save much money when it comes to food, but we picked the places where the food was fairly priced (read eat where locals eat).

We usually spent around<strong> 50,000 VND for a huge meal</strong> (including drinks sometimes). Always go for the street food where you can find many locals eating as it means the food is great and not overpriced. If you can’t see the prices, always ask for the prices in front as some people will definitely take advantage of you being a foreigner.

Don’t be surprised if you see locals are paying less money than you as they are eating there probably every day and know people around. Even if you get charged a bit extra, it won’t affect you for sure! My advice always goes for street food as you will get amazing portions for a reasonable price and also the variety of food is amazing. If you’re scared that the food preparation or ingredients aren’t clean, don’t be!

Many people are eating there and nothing happens. Also, our travel group had three members and we never experienced any stomach problems, except when we were drinking their homemade rice wine. Be careful with that stuff! :) When it comes to drinks, expect to pay a peanut amount for domestic beers, delicious and strong coffee, and all other drinks.

Also, don’t forget to try their fresh beer (Bia Hoi or Bia Tuoi). It’s usually a homemade beer made by locals that goes so well with street food. In some places, we found <strong>2L of fresh beer for whopping 20,000 VND</strong> which is less than a dollar!
<div class="single_post_info_box"><i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle fa-2x"></i> <strong>Environmental tip:</strong> Please invest in a reusable water bottle as Vietnam is lacking the infrastructure for recycling so all the plastic is being burned or end up in the ocean. Good reusable bottles will cost you around $30. Another viable option is buying a plastic reusable BPA-free bottle for a few dollars in every bigger supermarket (BigC has many choices).</div>
Almost every household has a huge water source and people are very hospitable, so they will welcome you with their hands opened if you ask for a bit of water. It saves the environment and also your wallet!

So, to conclude the budget for the food, expect to put aside about <strong>200,000 VND daily for food and drinks (backpacker's budget)</strong>.
<h3><strong>Transportation</strong></h3>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4741" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.transportation-in-vietnam.jpg" alt="Transportation in Vietnam" width="998" height="720" /> Vietnam is a fast developing country, so transportation options won't lack. Traveling around the country is possible with shuttles, buses, trains, planes, taxis, cars, motorbikes, and a variety of self-made vehicles (don't try it please). We chose the last mean of transportation - a motorbike. This way became very popular among backpackers and hundreds of people are doing a trip every day.

It’s not a strange thing that the motorbike market became very huge and it is very easy to get a motorbike and sell it after you’re doing on a trip. Check out this backpackers group to see which motorbikes are on the market and what are the prices. I’ve got myself a Sufat Win (Vietnamese version of Honda) and <a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/motorbike-in-vietnam"><strong>I’ve got it as a gift in Hanoi</strong></a>.

Usually, these bikes have a price of around $200 and you can, with a bit of luck, sell it for the same price. If you decide on a motorbike, then expect to pay around $200 - $400 for a decent bike. I really advise you to invest a bit more as this extra buck will save you a lot of time on the road! More on that soon! :) We drove around 200 km on average on every trip.

It seems like nothing on the paper, but believe me, these rides can sometimes take you a whole day!

<strong>If you want to have an accurate time estimation, multiple Google Maps estimation by two! </strong> The roads are in very bad conditions in some parts, the traffic can be crazy and also, weather, nature and motorbike breakdowns will be your daily friends. The cost for gas is around <strong>20,000 VND for a liter</strong> and you can usually <strong>drive up to 50 km on one liter</strong>.

So, depending on your plan, the gas costs will vary. Also, you need to regularly maintain your motorbike which includes tightening the brakes, chain and changing the oil every 500 - 1,000 km. The oil change costs around 100,000 VND. Breakdowns are inevitable, but luckily small mechanic shops are on each step.

These people usually know how to fix everything when it comes to Honda (or replica) bikes. Read more about the costs of bikes and breakdowns in our guide on <a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/buy-motorbike-in-vietnam" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>buying a motorbike in Vietnam</strong></a>. When we put everything on the paper, we spent around 250,000 VND per day for our motorbikes (gas, maintenance and repairs).

When it comes to budgeting, the buses are a bit cheaper but offering faster transport. You can also travel during the night and sleep there (sleeper buses can be a very good option if you’re not taller than 170 cm). It’s awesome as you can stop a bus everywhere on the road. Just stay on the road, wave to the bus driver and they will stop if they still have seats.

Be sure to prepare Google Translate and don’t accept the first price if it doesn’t seem right. Bus drivers will usually overcharge you, but with little bargaining skills, you will get a fair price.

Prepare your phone with <a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/mobile-apps-vietnam" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>handy mobile apps</strong></a> that will make your trip around Vietnam much easier! <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4740" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.train-in-vietnam.jpg" alt="Train in Vietnam" width="968" height="646" /> Although buses are very convenient to come from A to B fast and safe, they won’t give you total freedom and amazing scenery you can experience driving a motorbike. The rides that are around 200 km will cost you around 100,000 - 250,000 VND. Check out the <strong><a href="https://vexere.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">website</a> </strong>for timetables and detailed prices. For instance, Hanoi to Da Nang in a sleeper bus will cost you about 350,000 VND.

Trains are a bit more expensive and the rides are longer, but you’ll experience stunning scenery on every train drive.

The price is a bit higher and you need to book a ticket a few days before as many locals tend to travel by train, especially at a longer distance. For instance, the price from Da Nang (central Vietnam) to Saigon (South Vietnam) will cost you around 1,000,000 VND. Do the math and see what’s the best option for you! :)

Also, Vietnam is developing at a crazy fast pace, so almost every bigger city has its own domestic airport which means you can travel by plane between cities for a funny amount of money. For instance, Hanoi to Saigon can cost as low as $40. If you’re lacking the time, that’s the best option!

Don't forget to read our ultimate guide on <a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/public-transportation-in-vietnam"><strong>public transport in Vietnam</strong></a>. You can find out all the details, websites, prices, and more for each means of transportation. Now you have many options on how to travel around Vietnam with different transportation options.

It’s up to you to choose your way, but if you have enough time (one month), just go for a full adventure and pick a bike and do the whole of Vietnam by the bike. That’s the experience you will always remember! :)
<h2><b>Safety in Vietnam</b></h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4736" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.safety-in-vietnam.jpg" alt="Vietnam is pretty safe country" width="1000" height="649" /> In general, Vietnam is one of the safest countries I’ve to have a chance to travel to. Through the journey of more than 1 year, driving the country twice, living in some crazy places, even <a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/border-crossing-vietnam-laos-motorbike"><strong>crossing to Laos by motorbike</strong></a>, I must say that I never felt in danger. After doing comprehensive research on the internet, I can say that Vietnam is a relatively safe country, even for solo travelers, but just don’t forget to use your common sense.

Bigger cities like Saigon, Hanoi, and Da Nang tend to have a higher rate of petty crimes, so keep your belongings near you all the time, especially when walking around busy and touristic places. There are many tourist traps in Vietnam, so don’t buy things you don’t need and don’t be sorry for people offering you many things. Their job is to make you feel sorry, so you just buy overpriced things you don’t need.

There are many <a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/scams-in-vietnam"><strong>scams in Vietnam</strong></a> and so many tourists fall on cheap tricks! The biggest safety issue in Vietnam is definitely traffic.

Traffic is crazy and there is an enormous amount of motorbikes, trucks, and buses on the road.  <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4737" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.safety2.jpg" alt="Be extra careful on the roads" width="971" height="646" /> Don’t hesitate to use your honk as much as possible. Be careful of buses and trucks as they usually drive like in the video games and they are always the fastest on the road. Sometimes, it seems like they don’t care about others so you'd better move away from their way. At first, the traffic will look very terrifying, especially if you've never had a chance to drive in Asia.

After some experience, you will see that people are used to the traffic and they know how to go with the flow with other people in traffic. Always be aware of every moving and non-moving object and don’t look too much around, especially when you’re driving around the cities. I had a motorbike accident where I crashed into another motorbike in the city.

Thank God, nothing serious happened and everyone was fine. People were extremely helpful and everything was sorted out in minutes. I just wanted to tell you that no matter how good your driving is, never get too confident or cocky on the roads.

Always drive defensive and you will be fine! :)

		<Excerpt>Vietnam has a very lively and passionate drinking culture. People invented many drinks including Bia Hoi. Learn everything about this iconic drink!</Excerpt>

		<Categories><![CDATA[Vietnam>Culture]]></Categories>
		<Content><![CDATA[Vietnamese people are very friendly, social and passionate when it comes to family, football, food and, of course, booze! Just a simple walk around the streets will give you the idea of a lively drinking scene in Vietnam. Wherever you are, there is a huge possibility you will hear <em>'Mot, Hai, Ba, Yo!'</em> shouted from dozens of men in the distance.

That is the Vietnamese way to enjoy their booze and say cheers. The chances are huge that you've heard for Bia Hoi a.k.a. a fresh beer before coming to Vietnam.

The beer culture and history are simply amazing. Bia Hoi is one of the most consumed alcoholic drinks in Vietnam. It’s dirt cheap, claimed to be fresh and made by local people. The beer itself contains around 3% alcohol, but it’s a very inaccurate measurement.

Locals usually produce their beer in a non-regulated environment, so you never know what you get (it's worth the risk!).

We really enjoyed Bia Hoi and experience around it, so we're going to share everything we know about this fantastic drink.
<h2><b>History of Bia Hoi </b></h2>
<p id="KkakMEp"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4846 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5d1adde22d4e3.jpg" alt="Bia Hoi history" width="907" height="642" /></p>
Last century was tough and dynamic for Vietnam and its people since the country went through one of the longest wars in recent history. Vietnamese people always adapt to the situation, so they <em>'invented'</em> many goods during the hardships to make their life easier, and more enjoyable. One of the <em>'inventions'</em> is an iconic Bia Hoi - or fresh beer.

It all started at the end of the 19th century when French colonialists founded the first brewery named Hommel Brewery which was located on Hoang Hoa Tham. In the beginning, the beer was only for the elite since production was quite expensive and locals weren’t keen on drinking an alcoholic drink from colonialists.

At that time, Vietnamese people were mainly producing and enjoying their rice wine!  The brewery’s output was very scarce counting just about 150 liters per day since it was serving only elite, mainly French people. In 1954., when the Vietnamese army won the French colonialists, they took over the brewery and renamed it to Hanoi Beverage Company.

That was just a beginning of the shiny beer history in Vietnam!  At the end of the 50s, there were a few types of beer brewed by the company. However, the conflicts and complications arose, so the materials like glass and aluminum were expensive and scarce. People needed to figure out a different way of storing beer.

Kegs were ideal as the beer could stay for an extended period without getting corrupted.  The moment when the beer started to be stored in the kegs was the birth of <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bia_h%C6%A1i">Bia Hoi</a></strong> as we know today! Still, at that time, Bia Hoi wasn’t a beloved drink of Vietnamese people since only a small portion of the population enjoyed that beverage, while the majority of the population stayed truthful to their beloved rice wine.

There was a shortage of rice during the 60s, so the leader, Ho Chi Minh, banned the production of alcoholic drinks from the rice. Rice was exclusively a food.

After that moment, Vietnamese people being alcoholic lovers, just gave a try to newly introduced Bia Hoi.

That was the point of no return for the iconic fresh beer!

Today, you can see many people enjoying the sips of this historic beverage around the streets of Hanoi and Saigon while sitting on tiny red chairs and eating fresh peanuts.
<h2><b>Wait! What About the Glasses?</b></h2>
<img class="wp-image-4847 size-full aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5d1ade14aeae4.jpg" alt="Bia Hoi glasses are made from recycled glass." width="975" height="641" />
<div class="image_description">Almost every pint for Bia Hoi is handmade!</div>
Since Bia Hoi is always stored in kegs and sometimes in plastic bottles, there was a massive demand for glasses. During the war, when Bia Hoi started to gain its popularity, materials were scarce, so Vietnamese people needed to be very creative while inventing the glasses! People were drinking beer from glass pints from beginnings. It’s a tradition now, and many people refuse to drink from any other glasses.

There is an <a href="https://e.vnexpress.net/news/video/the-story-behind-hanoi-s-40-year-old-bia-hoi-glass-3633585.html"><strong>interesting story behind the imperfectly shaped glasses</strong></a>. There are a few factories around North Vietnam that produce glasses for Bia Hoi. They collect and recycle the broken glass around the country. After recycling, the glass undergoes a heating process for roughly six hours and then shaped into a glass shape. Afterward, the cups were buried in the ash, so the process of cooling down isn't too rapid.

Almost every glass is hand-made, even today! That’s a crazy fact to know, especially when the consumption is crazy high, and demand for glasses is growing with every day.
<h2><b>Unbelievable Bia Hoi Facts You've Never Heard Of!</b></h2>
The history of Bia Hoi is fascinating, which means there are many unbelievable facts behind this favorite beverage.
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Cheapest beer in the world</strong><b> - </b>after extensive research and walking around the cities around Vietnam to help ourselves with a glass of delicious and cold fresh beer, we believe it’s the world’s cheapest beer. One cup of 0.4l costs from 3,000 - 5,000 VND on the street. Expect a good buzz for a couple of dollars! How crazy it is?</li>
 	<li><strong>Handmade cups made from recycled glass</strong> - even when the demand and consumption are at its highest point, the cups are handmade from recycled glass. Literally, a few families around North Vietnam run small family factories where the magic happens. They are the leading distributors of the Bia Hoi glasses in Vietnam!</li>
 	<li><strong>Birth of Bia Hoi</strong><b> - </b>it’s a very amazing story that goes behind making the first cup of fresh beer. Vietnamese people enjoy their alcohol and spending their time with beloved friends, but during the war, the drink of choice was rice wine. Since the shortage, the rice was banned for alcohol production, but it didn’t stop people from drinking. They just switched to a fresh beer and that’s how this drink becomes very popular today!</li>
 	<li><strong>Bottoms up</strong><b> - </b>Vietnamese people don’t mess around when it comes to beer! Their style of drinking hugely differs from drinking styles around the world. They drink their fresh beer usually bottoms up! If you ever drink with Vietnamese people, be prepared to get totally drunk since finishing beers in one sip was never a thing for just a casual meeting with friends!</li>
 	<li><strong>Snack goes very well with beer</strong><b> - </b>it’s hard to see anyone drinking beer without snacking! People usually eat fresh peanuts, spring rolls, fried chicken wings, dried chicken, or squid. Food is usually very spicy or goes with the chili which just makes you more thirsty for this magical beverage! Don't forget to try <a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/vietnamese-street-food"><strong>street food in Vietnam</strong></a> as it's the staple of Vietnamese culture.</li>
</ul>
<h2><b>Where to Drink Bia Hoi? </b></h2>
<p id="gjkMBYB"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4848 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5d1ade622d147.jpg" alt="Places to drink Bia Hoi" width="710" height="535" /></p>
Finding a fresh beer place shouldn’t be a problem in some places, but still, it’s hardly possible to find it anywhere. Locals mainly consume fresh beer in North Vietnam as it originates from Hanoi.

The good news is that the majority of travelers lands in either Hanoi or Saigon (HCMC) and these two cities are full of Bia Hoi places!

If it's your first time in Vietnam, be sure to prepare yourself for <a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/culture-shocks-in-vietnam"><strong>dozens of culture shocks</strong></a>!
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b>Best Places to Drink Bia Hoi in Hanoi</b></h2>
Bia Hoi originates from Hanoi, so it’s literally effortless to find a place to sit and drink. Alright, a place to sit can be tough to find since it’s usually filled with thirsty people. There are many places, but the best experience is around the iconic Old Quarter area.

<b>Note: </b>We didn’t try all of these bars/places, but we found out a few places that people continuously mention by the excellence of the fresh beer, so we shared these places!
<h3><b>Beer Corner</b></h3>
That’s the busiest street when it comes to drinking. People started to call this location as a 'Beer street' as once you start walking around you won’t see any other thing than beer, red chairs and a lot of spicy snacks. And yeah, you will hear a lot of cheers on Vietnamese every second!  One beer usually costs from 5,000 - 8,000 VND and it can be a tough thing to find a free chair to sit.

Come there around 6 pm while Vietnamese people are enjoying dinner with their families.  The only downfall of the place (in our opinion) is that the place is totally spoiled and everyone wants to make money from the fresh beer.

There are too many restaurants filled with drunk backpackers mainly. We usually skip these places that don’t provide with the authenticity of the culture.

<strong><em>Navigate Beer Corner on the map:</em></strong>

<h3><b>Bia Hoi Restaurants</b></h3>
If you’re not looking for a specific place to drink Bia Hoi, then Bia Hoi Ha Noi restaurants are perfect spots. These small, tiny local restaurants are located around the city. You can see the sign from the street and they are serving mainly fresh beer combined with simple local food that can go well with beer.  It’s worth the try and the beer is usually a bit cheaper than in the Old Quarter.

Also, the main customers in these bars are locals which gives you a unique vibe while drinking there.

Be prepared to get invited by locals to their table, or they will invite themselves to your table, and get few beers more than expected!
<h3><b>Bia Hoi Joint at 50 Bat Dan</b></h3>
This one is a small street filled with dozen restaurants and bars on the street where mainly locals enjoy their fresh beer and local food.

There are not many foreigners, so you can definitely experience a real and authentic culture of beer drinking in Vietnam.  The glass of a fresh beer will cost you from 3,000 - 5,000 VND on this place!

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b>Best Places to Drink Bia Hoi in Saigon (HCMC)</b></h2>
Although the fresh beer originates from North Vietnam, it’s so popular around the country that can be easily found in Saigon too. The culture of drinking isn’t that huge like in Hanoi, but still, it’s not uncommon to see people crushing the beer until they can’t sit on the chairs anymore.  It’s very interesting information that the government occasionally bans Bia Hoi in Saigon since there are many reports of illness after consuming it.

The biggest concern is the cleanness and quality of the beer since it’s easy to get spoiled, some people continue to sell it anyway. That makes a fresh beer kind of scarce in Saigon.

Anyway, there are a few known places where you can enjoy a favorite Vietnamese drink.
<h3><b>Bia Sai Gon 73</b></h3>
This small street bar is located in the middle of Bui Vien street - a backpackers’ street in Saigon. It’s hard to miss this place since it’s overpacked with people and tiny red and blue chairs. The majority of customers there are backpackers, but still, there are some locals too, so it’s a great way to socialize and meet new friends.

This bar offers few food selections which go well with the beer!  The price of the beer is a bit higher than in Hanoi and other places, so one glass will cost you 10,000 VND.  The place is a bit spoiled with tourists, but still, it’s a lively place that will definitely provide you with an amazing experience. It’s very hot there since they have only a few fans pointing to the people, so be prepared to drink a lot!

Is it a strategy or pure coincidence, let’s leave it to you to judge!

<h3><b>Bia Hoi Ha Noi</b></h3>
This restaurant is a trendy choice for local people who enjoy delicious food combined with a fresh beer. The place isn’t thrown in the middle of hell like the previous place we mentioned, so the atmosphere is a bit more chilled and it provides you with more authentic experience.

The majority of the clientele of this restaurant is the working class who wants to get relaxed after a hard day at work.

They usually start to eat and drink around 6 pm and stay up to 11 pm. If you’re planning to visit or stay a bit longer, be prepared to get many toasts with locals! Just be ready for doing countless bottom ups with beers which will make even the most experienced drinker drunk!

The beer costs from 5,000 - 8,000 VND!
<h2><b>How Safe is Bia Hoi?</b></h2>
There are many discussions when it comes to the safety of fresh beer which is totally logical question since the majority of bia hoi is home-brewed beer.

We tried fresh beer around Vietnam, in Hanoi, Saigon, Da Nang, and even in the countryside and around the Highlands. We didn’t experience any problems while drinking. The only problem was a hangover, but it’s normal since we were usually drinking with locals who were insisting on finishing a beer in one sip. It just adds up after a few bottom ups!  After talking with some expats and travelers, we didn’t hear any negative experience about Bia Hoi, so it’s more than enough for us to say it’s totally safe to drink it.

Be responsible drinker and you’ll be fine! Maybe the morning headache will occur, but it’s normal when you’re drinking the low-quality alcohol without a known origin. Just enjoy and dip in the Vietnamese culture!

<hr />

Once you set your foot in Vietnam and get used to the climate, it’s time for exploration. If you really want to experience and immerse in the culture, then what could be a better way than checking local places and drink Bia Hoi with local people?

Enjoy and don’t do stupid things when you’re drunk!]]></Content>

		<Content><![CDATA[Getting bored in a constant hustle and bustle of Da Nang isn't anything new. Luckily, there are many creative ways to get out of the city's routine and experience something new. Driving a Prao loop with a motorbike is a perfect getaway from a busy city (especially in a tourist season). The whole loop is about <strong>200 km long and can be easily done in one day</strong>.

I did a whole loop twice, both times in one day (wished that I've had a bit more time to spend a night on the road). Prao loop is an extremely amazing and fun loop to drive since it features breathtaking passes, windy roads, beautiful mountains, wild rivers, green jungle, tiny villages and loads of rice fields.

Sounds like an ideal getaway from a noisy city? Perfect! Get your bike ready and prepare yourself for adventure.

Here's everything you need to know about the iconic Prao loop.
<h2><strong>Where is Prao Loop and How to Start?</strong></h2>
The whole loop is located in the heart of mountainous Quang Nam province bordering, on parts, with Da Nang city. If you're living in Da Nang, Hue or Hoi An (even Tam Ky), this might be a great way to immerse yourself in the extremely pleasant driving experience.

<em>I don't want to leave anything to your imagination, so here's the map:</em>
<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe style="border: 0;" src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m42!1m12!1m3!1d245575.51460126368!2d107.78333973800574!3d15.902918427251013!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!4m27!3e0!4m5!1s0x314219c792252a13%3A0xfc14e3a044436487!2zRGEgTmFuZywgSOG6o2kgQ2jDonUgRGlzdHJpY3QsIERhIE5hbmc!3m2!1d16.0544068!2d108.20216669999999!4m5!1s0x3141dd98c11fdc5d%3A0x39a7dd0a7ccb4e80!2sPrao%2C+%C4%90%C3%B4ng+Giang%2C+Quang+Nam+Province%2C+Vietnam!3m2!1d15.927263199999999!2d107.6392892!4m5!1s0x316a083fc0000001%3A0x77501fc26e15a017!2zVGjhuqFuaCBN4bu5LCB0dC4gVGjhuqFuaCBN4bu5LCBOYW0gR2lhbmcgRGlzdHJpY3QsIFF1YW5nIE5hbSBQcm92aW5jZQ!3m2!1d15.7598408!2d107.8330254!4m3!3m2!1d15.9313773!2d108.1309448!4m3!3m2!1d16.0515214!2d108.2013715!5e0!3m2!1sen!2s!4v1562763864448!5m2!1sen!2s" width="600" height="450" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
As I'm currently living in Da Nang city, I hit the road from Da Nang. The first stop was a tiny town called Prao. After Prao, I've followed the windy and mountainous road to Thanh My. From there I've just followed the road through countless villages all the way to Da Nang.

<strong><em>There are a few possible routes to complete the Prao loop:</em></strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Hoi An - Thanh My - Prao - Da Nang - Hoi An</li>
 	<li>Da Nang - Prao - Thanh Mi - Hoi An - Da Nang</li>
 	<li>Hue - Prao - Thanh My - Hoi An - Da Nang - Hue</li>
</ul>
Basically, it's totally up to you which route will you take. You can even widen the loop and do it all the way from Hue to Tam Ky (heard it's very nice, especially south of Thanh My).

The whole loop will take you a whole day (including rests and stops for stunning views). Start early in the morning as you'll want to reach Prao (or first stop) before noon. It's extremely hot in the mountains and the sun is so strong.
<h2><strong>1st Section: Da Nang -&gt; Prao</strong></h2>
If you're heading from Da Nang, the best (and fastest) option is to reach Cam Le district. Just stay on Nguyen Huu Tho street until you reach the bridge.

Turn right and follow AH17 road all the way to a huge intersection with CT road. Please note that CT marked roads are new highways only for cars. After you pass the huge intersection you're going to turn the first right to Quang Xuong road that becomes QL14G later.

You can't miss Prao once you're on that road since there is only one main road leading to Prao. Just stay and keep going. The biggest struggle is getting out of the city as the road through Cam Le district is usually packed with container trucks. Once you get out of the main road, it becomes easier and more scenic to drive.

On the way to the mountains, there are a few tourist attractions and water parks so the first section of the road can be a bit busy from time to time. It's very funny to see the conditions of the road drastically changes for worse once you pass the water park.

After a waterpark, you slowly continue to ascend and drive through beautiful passes. The road conditions aren't the best and there are many potholes, so be extremely careful.

On the way to Prao, there are countless tiny villages, tea plantations, and beautiful mountains on the horizon. It will take you around 2 hours to reach Prao and you might be frustrated from time to time because of road conditions, but don't worry as the real pleasure is following soon. Once you reach Prao, there is nothing much going on. It's a small and quiet town in the middle of the Highlands.

There are two main roads leading from the town. One to Laos border (north) and one to Thanh My (south). The main market is always noisy as usual, people have wedding parties over there. Just on the main road, there is a cozy cafe where you can refill your energy with a <strong><a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/vietnamese-drip-coffee-guide">strong Vietnamese coffee</a></strong>. There are countless street restaurants serving delicious rice and noodles.

Also, if you decide to stay in Prao for a night and explore the surrounding area there are a few guesthouses (Nha Nghi) on the main road. The average price for a room is 200,000 VND/night. Tay Giang is just 56 km away from Prao and it's a great place to visit and admire stunning views.

Unfortunately, I didn't have time to visit this stunning place since it means staying in Prao for a night.

<h2><strong>2nd Section: Prao -&gt; Thanh My</strong></h2>
You've probably experienced some frustration on the road to Prao, right? Well, as I've mentioned before, the real chunk of the loop is just coming. Prao to Thanh My is by far the most stunning part of the loop.

The distance between these two towns is 56 km of pure pleasure. This is definitely in the top 5 roads in my opinion in the whole of Vietnam (I've been driving for more than 30,000 km around the country).

At the very beginning, the road starts to ascend a bit leading you to the top of the surrounding mountain. After a short ascent, you'll start to descend through a windy road surrounded by a beautiful valley and mountainous chain.

The river is passing through the valley and it helps in making the electricity. There is really nothing much to say about the road and its conditions. I haven't experienced any potholes, the road is very wide, windy, and empty.

It's a great ride and you can get yourself a bit loose if you know what you're doing. Thanh My, similar to Prao, lays on two main roads. One road leads to Da Nang (coast) while the other road leads to Kon Tum (Highlands).

On the main road, you can find a few guesthouses (200,000 VND/night) as well as local restaurants offering delicious food and drinks. My favorite spot is by far Nuoc Mia place with hammocks. There are a few places on the road where you can order a cold drink while resting in a hammock. It's just perfect to lay down a bit after a long, and uncomfortable drive (who drives Honda Wave knows!).

I don't want to write too much about the road and its surroundings as I believe pictures tell everything:

<h2><strong>3rd Section: Thanh My -&gt; Da Nang</strong></h2>
The last section isn't so iconic as a previous one but has its charm. The first 20 km are very beautiful as you'll stumble upon stunning mountains and passes, but after the first section, the road becomes narrow and busy. Pretty soon you'll reach tiny villages on the road with many restaurants and shops. The things that I like the most about this section are corn and rice fields.

It looks extremely beautiful when the sun sets over it. Be extra careful while driving on the road since there are only two tracks and the road is packed with trucks and cars who don't care much about anything that's smaller than them on the road. Pretty soon you'll reach the big intersection with CT road from the beginning of the Prao loop.

It's the sign you're slowly getting back to the city.

<h2><strong>Prao Loop is a Perfect Getaway From Da Nang City!</strong></h2>
If you have your own motorbike and you love to drive, then hitting the Prao loop is definitely a thing you have to do once. The whole loop will take a whole day, or even two, but the experience is totally worth the time. Pack enough water, prepare your motorbike, get some riding buddies and let's hit the road. If you have any questions about the loop, please don't hesitate to ask.

Also, we did an interesting write-up on <strong><a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/son-tra-peninsula">Son Tra Peninsula day trip</a></strong> that might be interesting if you're living in or around Da Nang city. For people who travel to Da Nang on a tight time, don't forget to read our <strong><a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/3-days-in-da-nang">72 hours in Da Nang</a></strong> itinerary.

Cheers and safe driving. :)]]></Content>

		<Content><![CDATA[Running out of ideas for nature getaways from busy Da Nang? You've visited all touristy spots in the city and explored a stunning nature surrounding the city and now, you're asking yourself is there anything more? Well, we've asked ourselves this question countless times. What we did was very simple. Took a motorbike and ride around the city (including Quang Nam) to explore something new.

Lately, we've been very interested in exploring Da Nang waterfalls and lakes. So far, we've explored a few beautiful waterfalls and secluded lakes where you can easily spend a few days camping and relaxing.

Believe us, you'll be surprised how many natural places you can find once you get out of the city and hit the countryside (we're going to write about these places soon).

For now, we'd like to talk about Soui Mo Hoa Bac waterfall that's a perfect spot for a day trip.
<h2><strong>How to Get to Suoi Mo Hoa Bac Waterfall?</strong></h2>
This one is by far one of the best waterfalls in Da Nang we've had a chance to explore. It's located just about an hour drive from the city. Getting there isn't so complicated, but as you get near the waterfall, be ready for some walking/driving through the jungle. <em>To get a better understanding of its location, here are directions:</em>
<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe style="border: 0;" src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m26!1m12!1m3!1d61338.08537535624!2d108.09993925468527!3d16.084661423056254!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!4m11!3e6!4m5!1s0x314219c792252a13%3A0xfc14e3a044436487!2zRGEgTmFuZywgSOG6o2kgQ2jDonUgRGlzdHJpY3QsIERhIE5hbmc!3m2!1d16.0544068!2d108.20216669999999!4m3!3m2!1d16.1388836!2d108.073346!5e0!3m2!1sen!2s!4v1563198180135!5m2!1sen!2s" width="600" height="450" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
No matter where are you starting from, to reach a waterfall you drive in the direction of Hai Van Pass. There are basically two main ways to reach Hai Van Pass - QL1A or Nguyen Tat Thanh Street. We recommend avoiding a busy QL1A as there are hundreds of traffic lights on the way and traffic can be very dangerous since that's the road massive containers and buses take. Nguyen Tat Thanh, on the other hand, has only a few traffic lights and offers an iconic view on Hai Van, a beautiful sandy beach and wide road.

At the end of the street, you're going to connect to QL1A (you can't avoid it), but traffic isn't that crazy anymore like through the city. Continue to follow QL1A until you pass Cau Nam O. After the bridge, you should take the first left turn (Ngo Xuan Thu). Just stay on the road and enjoy the view! The road and its surrounding scenery are beautiful.

You'll follow the river, paddy fields and stunning mountains in a distance. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-4898 " src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.path_.jpg" alt="Path to Soui Mo Waterfall" width="634" height="845" /> <strong><em>Once you get to the marked location, there are two options:</em></strong>
<ul>
 	<li>you leave the bike (there is a small abandoned house) and walk to the waterfall (around 20 minutes walk)</li>
 	<li>or you drive the bike all the way to waterfall (there is a path full of rocks and it can be tough to drive)</li>
</ul>
We did both. The first time, we walked as it seemed there is no way we could drive our bikes up there. Once we reached the waterfall area, people told us to get the bike here as there were some bike stealing recently. We returned back for the bike and drove it all the way through a bumpy road full of stones. Not the most comfortable drive, but better be safe than sorry.

The whole way is paved as the waterfall is mainly visited by locals who have nhau there. We went during the weekend and the waterfall was packed with locals enjoying foods and drinks.

It wasn't crowded and you can find the place to have a whole waterfall for yourself.
<h2><strong>Handy Tips for Visiting Suoi </strong><strong>Mo Hoa Bac Waterfall</strong></h2>
We've randomly decided to visit one of the most beautiful Da Nang waterfalls, so the preparation was almost unexistent. However, after the trip to this stunning waterfall, here are some handy tips that will make your trip better:
<ul>
 	<li>take enough water, snacks, drinks as this place is perfect for relaxing for a whole day</li>
 	<li>not advisable to go after the rainy period since the paved road will be hard or impossible to pass</li>
 	<li>drive your motorbike all the way to the waterfall (there is a security guy who'll watch over your bike for 10,000 VND)</li>
 	<li>don't forget to apply a sunscreen</li>
 	<li>don't hand over any trash to a security guy as he will just throw everything in the river</li>
</ul>
That would be it! The whole trip is around 30 km and it takes about one hour to reach the waterfall. There are plenty a few pools of crystal clear water and cliffs for jumping.

		<Content><![CDATA[Da Nang is slowly, but surely becoming the main touristic destination in Vietnam. Last year alone, Da Nang hosted more than <a href="http://vietnamtourism.gov.vn/english/index.php/items/13634">7.5 million tourists</a> and tourism experts predict more than 8 million tourists this year. The city is going through major development and many people ask the same question - when is the best time to visit Da Nang? Since Da Nang features a monsoon season, it's important to plan your visit accordingly. The city has two parts - a beachside and the city center.

The east side is known for tourism, chilled expat community, stunning sandy beach, and <a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/son-tra-peninsula">Son Tra peninsula</a>. On the other hand, a city center features a local vibe, museums, delicious and diverse food, and extremely friendly locals. I am going to go through weather statistics and explain different seasons in Da Nang. After that, I will share my experience with seasons since I've been living in Da Nang for 11 months.

Let's plan your trip to Da Nang together.
<h2><strong>Seasons in Da Nang</strong></h2>
Da Nang has a monsoon climate and distinct between two seasons - wet and dry season. Officially, a dry season starts from January all the way to the beginning of September. Wet season takes place from September to early January. Since Da Nang features a tropical, or monsoon climate, the rainfall through the year is significant, especially during the wet season.
<p id="wnJzrSx"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4919 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5d31c137710f9.jpg" alt="Average rainfall and temperatures in Da Nang" width="921" height="691" /></p>
On the graph above you can see the amount of rainfall in Da Nang in 2017. The red line represents the average temperature for each month. You can notice that rainfall significantly increases in September and peaks in October. February is the first month of the dry season with low rainfall. The average yearly temperature (2017.) was 25.7°C. Temperatures start to rise from the middle of March and peaking through June and July.

Don't forget to check the detailed <a href="https://www.weather-atlas.com/en/vietnam/da-nang-climate">weather statistics of Da Nang</a>.
<h2><strong>Best Time to Visit Da Nang?</strong></h2>
<p id="YZnoowm"><img class="wp-image-4937 size-full aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5d32c984aad4a.jpg" alt="Da Nang rooftop view" width="1330" height="714" /></p>
Da Nang is widely popular by its sandy coast, lovely city center radiating with a local vibe, stunning surrounding nature, friendly people, and much more. Majority of tourists who're visiting Da Nang come here mainly because of beaches and nature which is partly a reason why Da Nang is extremely busy during the dry season.

Tet holiday falls in the first week of February and that's the time when the city is literally empty since people move to <a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/tet-holiday-vietnam">celebrate Tet holiday</a> with their families (usually countryside). The temperatures around that time averages around 22°C which results in chilly days and cold nights. From the beginning of March, temperatures slowly start to rise while rainfall decreases.

Based on our experience and statistical data, it's safe to say that the <strong>best time to visit Da Nang is anytime between March and August</strong>.
<h2><strong>Budget &amp; Prices Through Seasons</strong></h2>
Da Nang, compared to other big cities like Hanoi and Saigon features a quite lower cost of living during the year. As the city thrives from tourism, it's easy to understand why the prices are seasonal. Food and drink prices usually stay the same, but rental prices skyrocket when the tourist season kicks in. January to March is the perfect time to visit Da Nang if you're on a budget.

The accommodation options are abundant and the prices are slightly lower compared to the upcoming dry season. You can also bargain since the market is huge, but the demand isn't so. Prices of everything starts to rise around April all the way to August. In September, the prices start to normalize again.
<p id="RCjrAyK"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4938 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5d32cbe4de723.jpg" alt="Beachside road in Da Nang" width="1330" height="709" /></p>
Da Nang has many options when it comes to accommodation including hostels, hotels, resorts, guest houses, and homestays. If you're a budget traveler, hostels are affordable all year round. You can find some cozy and social hostels in the city center for as low as 50,000 VND per night. On the other side of the city (beachside) hostels are a bit more expensive with an average price of 80,000 VND per night.

We loved to stay in the Fedora hostel that is near the airport. The night included breakfast costs 89,000 VND. The staff is extremely friendly, the rooms are comfortable and quiet, plus the rooftop view is just amazing. (We're not affiliated with the hostel in any way, nor we earn any money mentioning the place. Just a friendly recommendation for a place we love to stay in!) Apartment prices tend to rise too.

I stayed in the apartment for around 6 months and the price was about 20% lower during the wet season. It happens mainly on the beachside of the city since it's the place where tourists flock in. If you're living for a longer period, it's recommended to figure out the prices through tourist season with the landlord and put everything in the contract.
<p id="NNOerqm"><img class="wp-image-4939 size-full aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5d32cc6053b70.jpg" alt="Fresh beer in Da Nang" width="1141" height="846" /></p>
Prices for food &amp; drinks usually stay the same, but it's important to avoid tourist spots if you're on the budget. For instance, a sugar cane juice (nuoc mia) on the local/regular street costs 5,000 - 8,000 VND, but for the same drink, you'll pay about 20,000 VND near the beach or in city center's tourist area.

It doesn't seem a lot, but believe us, these small costs add up very fast and burn your budget. Be aware of your budget and spend your money accordingly.
<h2><strong>Personal Experience &amp; Recommendation</strong></h2>
I've been living in Da Nang for the past 11 months and visited the city countless times before finally deciding to move here. Here's my personal experience that might help you while planning your visit to Da Nang.
<h3><strong>August - November</strong></h3>
<p id="KCAstKw"><img class="wp-image-4940 size-full aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5d32ccca83a7d.jpg" alt="Beach in the fall" width="1163" height="856" /></p>
The first time I've arrived in Da Nang was August and the weather couldn't be better. We drove from the rainy north and finally had sunshine and a stunning beach in front of us. The tourist season was still in high gear, the place was filled with tourists, but we decided to stay in Thanh Khe district which is a local place. The vibes were great and prices were local.

Weather in September starts to change introducing occasional rain and storms, but it's still good to hit a beach on a daily basis. October is also a very good month for swimming and driving around, but everything changes from the beginning of November. Temperatures were still around 23°C, but the weather started to be unstable with constant daily showers/storms/rains.

If you're looking to have a great time when you still can hit the beach every day, we recommend visiting Da Nang from the end of August to the beginning of October. There are not so many tourists around and the prices start to drop.

The perfect period for budget travelers.
<h3><strong>December - March</strong></h3>
<p id="TntOOGj"><img class="wp-image-4941 size-full aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5d32cd03a1293.jpg" alt="Rainy season in Da Nang" width="1146" height="803" /></p>
December and early January are probably the worst months to be in Da Nang. The constant rain, cold weather, and floods are the part of daily life. There was huge flooding that devastated the city center at the beginning of December. I remember that for a week I couldn't move out of the apartment. This period is ideal if you want to spend time in cafes while focusing on the projects.

During that period, I've explored quite a lot of cafes around the city and come up with a list of the <a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/working-cafes-in-da-nang">best working cafes in Da Nang</a>. Around the beginning of February, the weather becomes a bit more stable, but it's still chilly outside.

People wear long sleeves while driving and nights can be cold. Locals love to say that the summer starts to kick in after Tet holiday and it was a really accurate statement.

From the middle of February, the weather starts to stabilize, with constant sunny days and even a beach time. The water was a bit cold for swimming, but if you prefer a cold swim, then it's a good time for you.

March to April are good months to visit since the weather is amazing and the prices are still the same as during the wet season.
<h3><strong>April - August</strong></h3>
<p id="lvSZTJO"><img class="wp-image-4942 size-full aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5d32cd55f014f.jpg" alt="My Khe beach during dry season." width="994" height="741" /></p>
This period is known as a dry season and it's the start of a tourist season. During April, prices started to rise, especially in the beachside area. Constant development is a part of life during that time.

Tourists start to flock in, and you can experience it in the traffic. The price of my apartment rose for a whopping 20% in April. Anyway, the weather is extremely stable and I don't remember if there were a few consecutive days of rain. I can probably count rainy days from April to July on my hands. It's really great time to be in Da Nang. Even if you're a budget traveler, you can enjoy Da Nang during the peak season as the total cost of your trip won't exceed 20%.

This period is ideal for exploring the surrounding area. We've explored beautiful <a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/da-nang-waterfalls">waterfalls in Da Nang</a> and drove <a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/prao-loop">Prao Loop</a>.

Be extra cautious when visiting tourist places as street vendors tend to pull scams on tourists (like in every touristic place).

We've written a huge list of <a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/scams-in-vietnam">scams in Vietnam</a> we've experienced during our 2 years in the country.
<h2><strong>So When to Visit Da Nang?</strong></h2>
<p id="MFJxjUh"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4943 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5d32cdc8a52d5.jpg" alt="Three Croatian guys on a rooftop" width="656" height="605" /></p>
Basically, it totally depends on your preferences and budget. Probably the main reasons for visiting Da Nang are beautiful beaches, relaxation and generally having a great time. We recommend avoiding anytime between the middle of November to the middle of February. September to November and March to April tend to be amazing for budget travelers.

Expect to pay at least 20% more for the whole trip if you're visiting between April and August. It's still affordable, even for budget backpackers. <strong>Best time to visit Da Nang - April to August.</strong>

		<Excerpt>We are exploring Saigon on our first day of the 40-day road trip through Cambodia and Vietnam! Reunion time and recovering from jet lag can make for a lovely day!</Excerpt>

		<Content><![CDATA[Our flight took us 8 hours to get from the Middle East to Southeast Asia. Seeing Saigon from the air and circling around the city around the Mekong delta is an amazing sight. We arrived at the Tân Sơn Nhat Airport really, really sleepy. Now, we just had to complete the bureaucratic procedure and get on exploring Saigon! This procedure can take quite a bit of time if there is a crowd in the lines.

<em>We have a <a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/vietnam-tourist-visa"><strong>Vietnam tourist visa 101 guide</strong></a> for you just here!</em> Also, a thing on notice, we bought <strong>SIM cards for 10 USD</strong> with a download speed of 1.2 Mbps. After exiting the airport, we got hit with that recognizable scent of a Vietnamese metropolis, a combination of wet, smell from the river, gasoline, and food.

A really unique combination. Really glad to be back in Vietnam! At the first moment we got out of the airport, we were approached by a guy who was claiming to be a Grab driver. He offered us a ride to our accommodation for 500.000 VND which is three times more than the regular Grab drive.

<em><strong>Pro tip:</strong> bargain <strong>all the time</strong>, and don’t make deals from the first offer in Vietnam!</em> Also, Grab doesn't work the best! It is essentially a more popular (and cheaper) alternative to Uber in Vietnam. Combined with the language barrier and shoddy location service, expect to sometimes wait in vain while your Grab driver is wondering where are you. Basically mutual wondering what is going on that costs you both time.

<em>We have a guide on the <a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/mobile-apps-vietnam"><strong>best mobile applications while exploring Saigon</strong></a>! Trust us, you will probably have a need to use one!</em>
<h2><strong>Arriving in Saigon </strong></h2>
<img class="wp-image-4954 size-large aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0087.jpg" alt="Exploring Saigon with Grab." width="1024" height="684" />
<div class="image_description"><em>Sights like this are pretty common in Saigon!</em></div>
Driving through the city with the real Grab though, I reminisced how much traffic is chaotic, especially here in Saigon. Once you see a guy riding a fridge 5 times bigger than him, vertically, on his motorbike, and actually balancing that stuff; you start to wonder again! <img class="wp-image-4955 size-large aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0109.jpg" alt="Inside the organized mess." width="1024" height="684" />
<div class="image_description"><em>Inside the organized mess.</em></div>
Once we arrived at our accommodation in District 2, Antonio came inside 15 minutes later. It’s so great to reunite again! And he lost his Ho Chi Minh backpacker beard! AJ, a very energetic and unique friend we met last year, also came sometime later, so it was the crew reunion time in a way! <img class="wp-image-4966 size-large aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0147.jpg" alt="The crew..." width="1024" height="684" />

<div class="image_description"><em>Meet AJ!</em></div>
<h2>Exploring Saigon</h2>
Tasting the local Pho (noodle soup) and Mi Xao (fried noodles) was really out of this world again. I really missed this fresh food with excellent taste combinations! After getting our food fix, we got some freshly made sugar cane juice and continued on to our rooftop! <img class="wp-image-4957 size-large aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0159.jpg" alt="This is Pho Bo, a rice noodle soup with beef." width="1024" height="684" />

<div class="image_description"><em>Nuoc Mia, sugar cane juice is being prepared.</em></div>
The rooftop is bloody amazing to say at least! It has a swimming pool, a few sofas, an impressive view over the Saigon skyline, and a billiard table with no holes. After smoking a doobie or two and just having a fantastic time listening to AJ stand-uppin' in comedy, we fainted in our beds after almost 2 days of not sleeping. <em>Find out more about <a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/weed-in-saigon"><strong>weed in Saigon!</strong></a></em>

We woke up at 10 PM and decided to find some food. What I forgot is that the bustling, motorbike-horn spamming vibe in the cities dies off after 10 PM.

After looking all over our neighborhood, we found a decent place to eat Mi Xao for some 60.000 VND (that is a bit over 2 USD). <img class="size-large wp-image-4961 aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0208.jpg" alt="Almost empty Saigon streets at night." width="1024" height="684" />

<div class="image_description"><em>Food usually gets served with soy sauce and chili.</em></div>
We returned to our rooftop, jumped in the swimming pool, and realized it was already morning! Really surprising to see how the jet lag has kicked in! Anyway, a charming day, and a much better impression of Saigon than last year! <img class="size-large wp-image-4965 aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0331.jpg" alt="Enjoying some Larue beer on the rooftop." width="1024" height="684" />

		<Content><![CDATA[The third day of our stay in Saigon was reserved for continuing our search for motorcycles in Saigon. We also got a little <em>surprise</em> that was totally expected though! Our biorhythm got programmed to sleeping to at least 2 PM.

This time, it was a bright sunny early afternoon, perfect to jump in the pool! After this energizer, we were ready to continue our search for the motorbikes. <img class="size-large wp-image-4989 aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0462.jpg" alt="The view from the rooftop.

<div class="image_description"><em>Lots of streets in the District 2 in Saigon are full of trees!</em></div>
But, before that, some street food! <em>Check out the best <a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/vietnamese-street-food"><strong>street food in Vietnam</strong></a> that you have to try!</em> <img class="size-large wp-image-4997 aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0507.jpg" alt="The street food place that we've become regulars at." width="1024" height="684" />
<div class="image_description"><em>The street food place that we've become regulars at.</em></div>
We sat down for an hour or so at the street food stall on the main street, and saw a dark cloud coming closer.

With the clouds came wind, and with the wind came the rain. Shortly after, heavy rain ensued. <img class="size-large wp-image-4995 aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0490.jpg" alt="Thao Dien is a pretty peaceful neighbourhood of Saigon." width="1024" height="684" />

<div class="image_description"><em>Kids in Vietnam really love posing for the camera!</em></div>
<h2><strong>Rainy Saigon</strong></h2>
We decided to split up to our first seller, who said that he could get us a deal of 3 Yamaha Nuovo bikes for 400$. Sounds too good to be true, but worth a look. Me and Antonio got to Saigon Motorcycles for the raincoats while Lovel and Darian took the Grab to the seller. The raincoats cost 200.000 VND each, and I also borrowed one of the helmets. Saigon traffic is really crazy!

Once Antonio and I got on the main street, we were riding through holes and labyrinthian passages of buses and cars. Bikes contest to get into their sweet spots. After taking a wrong turn at the labyrinthian alley and losing GPS signal, we managed to find the seller even before the Grab ride came over there. <img class="size-large wp-image-5000 aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0524.jpg" alt="Riding around alleys in Saigon. Sometimes you feel like a small ant in the heavy traffic in Saigon." width="1024" height="684" />
<div class="image_description"><em>Riding around alleys in Saigon. Sometimes you feel like a small ant in the heavy traffic in Saigon.</em></div>
There weren’t any Yamaha Nuovo bikes, but there was SYM Atilla bike for 7.000.000 VND and Yamaha Sirius for 9.000.000 VND. I tried out the Atilla but realized that I would need something different for the roads of Cambodia.

After checking out the first shop, we had another agreement deeper inside District 25. The rain started pouring even more, and we got there with a Grab drive while Antonio followed us on his bike. <img class="size-large wp-image-5002 aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0532.jpg" alt="An actual car is great for rain protection!" width="1024" height="684" />

<div class="image_description"><em>The traffic in Saigon continues regardless of heavy rain. Things just get more dangerous in these conditions, but, it's perfectly normal!</em></div>
The second seller wasn’t around, so we took a walk around to see if there are more places to find bikes. We found a place that was selling a lot of bikes between 4.000.000 VND and 12.000.000 VND.

The owner of the shop also knew very good English and was really lighthearted with the bargaining jokes. <img class="size-large wp-image-5001 aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0566.jpg" alt="The happiness when your workplace is inside and the poor sods are out there on the downpour." width="1024" height="684" />
<div class="image_description"><em>The happiness when your workplace is inside and the poor sods are out there on the downpour.</em></div>
Another arrangement with Saigon Motorcycles was waiting, so we decided to check that option out again. The owner called us a Grab, and we drove through the rainy and heavy traffic back to our neighborhood, with Antonio following the car again. This time, we got to try two newer Yamaha Nuovo models. Some of them need some patching up, but the driving conditions are reasonable for now.

When you consider the prices that are between 5.000.000 VND and 8.000.000 VND, it’s a good deal! The bikes also have phone holders, which can be quite useful for road trips in Vietnam. We agreed to come back tomorrow morning to check out the patched up bikes and make the final decision. <img class="size-large wp-image-4993 aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0607.jpg" alt="Finishing the day with some tasty Com Ram Bo!" width="1024" height="684" />
<div class="image_description"><em>Finishing the day with some tasty Com Ram Bo!</em></div>
There is still some of the night left to relax and get back to the world of remote work a bit.

		<Content><![CDATA[This day was reserved to start our search for the motorbikes in Saigon. There are a plenty of options, and we need to make our choice in the few days we are staying in Saigon. <em>Here is all you have to know about <a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/buy-motorbike-in-vietnam"><strong>buying a motorbike in Vietnam!</strong></a></em>
<h2>Looking for Motorbikes in Saigon</h2>
In the end we woke up in 2 PM. Jet lag can induce this in the first days of switching 5 time zones. AJ came around our apartment and we chilled a bit on the rooftop. Daytime view over the Saigon skyline and Landmark 81 is simply jaw-dropping! <img class="size-large wp-image-4977 aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0332.jpg" alt="Cruising around on Honda Wave." width="1024" height="684" />
<div class="image_description"><em>Cruising around on Honda Wave.</em></div>
We realized that we should find something to eat really fast. Vietnamese food is very light, full-on carbohydrates, and not so much with protein. Antonio’s Honda Wave was strong enough to hold three people on board, a sight you see often in Vietnamese traffic. <img class="size-large wp-image-4978 aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0334.jpg" alt="Lots of construction work is taking place in Saigon." width="1024" height="684" />

<div class="image_description"><em>Mi Xao Bo is a decent way to kickstart the day!</em></div>
After getting some much-needed energy, it was time to look for the bikes. Saigon Motorcycles was our first stop. The owner there is an older Vietnamese woman that surprisingly knows very good English!

She has lots of bike gear in her shop, including helmets and raincoats, which are pretty much essential.  <img class="wp-image-4980 size-large aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0356.jpg" alt="Crossing the street in Vietnam can be sometimes challenging.

<div class="image_description"><em>Crossing the street in Vietnam can be sometimes challenging. It is easy to adapt though. There are a lot of motorbikes in Saigon that congest the traffic there.</em></div>
We still didn’t decide from the Yamaha Nuovo and Suzuki Hayata automatic bikes and we told the owner that we will visit tomorrow.  There is a nearby place just off the street that makes good Banh Mi. It is also quite cheap, some 15.000 VND. <img class="wp-image-4981 size-large aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0360.jpg" alt="This is a Banh Mi street stall.

<div class="image_description"><em>This is a Banh Mi street stall. It is a baguette sandwich filled with meat, eggs and vegetables; all toppled with some sweet soy sauce and chili sauce!</em></div>
Inside, we got our first Vietnamese coffee sip in a while. Trust me, it is absolutely phenomenal. Definitely on my top 3 coffee list! This sweet and creamy taste combined with a slight bitterness is just <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">pizzicato!</span></i>

So good that we actually took two cups of coffee which energized us even further! <img class="wp-image-4982 size-large aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0387.jpg" alt="Sweet and tasty Vietnamese coffee." width="1024" height="684" />
<div class="image_description"><em>Sweet and tasty Vietnamese coffee.</em></div>
<h2><strong>Relaxing on the rooftop</strong></h2>
We returned to our apartment at the evening. The rooftop was an immediate choice for the next few hours. <img class="wp-image-4988 size-large aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0416.jpg" alt="Saigon slowly going to sleep.

<div class="image_description"><em>Saigon slowly going to sleep. Finishing our search for motorbikes in Saigon for today.</em></div>
AJ also came around. We just sat there, had an amazing time, and a lovely view over the Saigon skyline. The swimming pool is also really nice at this hour.  <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-4985" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0423.jpg" alt="Relaxing on the rooftop." width="1024" height="684" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-4986" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0429.jpg" alt="Chill by the pool." width="1024" height="684" /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-4987" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0448.jpg" alt="Swimming in the pool." width="1024" height="684" /> At one point, me and Lovel went to buy some snacks to the 7/11 store. It was a really long walk. We met a girl called Đurđa halfway through. She comes from Montenegro and lives in Saigon for almost a year and a half. It was a "small world, eh?" moment for sure. She confirmed to us where is the store and we continued on.

After chilling out some more on the rooftop of our accommodation, we decided that it was high time to go to sleep. We still have to check out other alternatives for bikes tomorrow. After all, there are a lot of motorbikes in Saigon!

		<Content><![CDATA[Today, we managed to negate the effect of biorhythm change and wake up at 11 AM. Today, it is time to get the bikes that we checked yesterday at Saigon Motorcycles shop. Before we went to buy the bikes, we tasted an awesome barbecue, egg, and rice combination. <img class="size-large wp-image-5031 aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.rice-egg.jpg" alt="The delicious combination of rice, egg and beef." width="1024" height="684" />
<div class="image_description">The delicious combination of rice, egg and beef.</div>
So, regarding the bikes. I bought Yamaha Nuovo 3, got a free helmet with a visor (Royal brand, not the best, but the visor is a godsend!), a luggage rack, and a phone holder.

All of that, for <strong>5.2 million VND!</strong> Lovel gave <strong>9.2 million VND</strong> for Yamaha Nuovo 4 and Darian gave<strong> 8 million VND.</strong>

<em>Here is all the information you will need on <a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/buy-motorbike-in-vietnam"><strong>buying a motorbike in Vietnam!</strong></a></em> <img class="size-large wp-image-5032 aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.mechanic.jpg" alt="The final check at the mechanic." width="1024" height="684" />
<div class="image_description">The final check at the mechanic.</div>
Finally, a new mode of transportation allowed us to explore some more. We rode to Thao Dien market and got some juicy fruit! We planned to visit the 'village inside of Saigon', Thanh Da; which was the first serious route to test the skills in the crazy Vietnamese traffic.

It is a lot easier than the first time, as I got used to keep with the flow of the traffic there, whether crazy that may sound. <img class="size-large wp-image-5033 aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.saigon-streets.jpg" alt="The wet streets of Saigon." width="1024" height="684" />

<div class="image_description">A random Porsche cruising in the rain.</div>
<h2>Exploring the Ben Thanh Market</h2>
After cruising through the village, we rode to <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293925-d311087-Reviews-Ben_Thanh_Market-Ho_Chi_Minh_City.html"><strong>Ben Thanh Market</strong></a> to check it out. It is a huge market, filled with many different stalls.

You name it, they have it. Lots of jewelry, wristbands, watches, clothes, and food! I was more interested in photographing the flow of the market rather than buying something though. <img class="size-large wp-image-5036 aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.ben-thanh-labyrinth.jpg" alt="Entering the labyrinth inside the Ben Thanh Market." width="1024" height="684" />

<div class="image_description">Make sure to bargain on the Ben Thanh Market!</div>
As it was already evening, we went to the same food place to eat dinner. On the way to the restaurant, Antonio got a slight breakdown on his bike, so he had to push the bike rest of the way. Funny observation, whether you get a motorbike breakdown in the middle of Saigon, some local will most likely help you with boosting you! Also, buying a smoking paper is really challenging in Saigon.

Best bets are some alternative-looking bars, as VinMart and 7/11 usually don't have them (some do, but it's a hit or miss situation). <img class="size-large wp-image-5039 aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.saigon-night.jpg" alt="Saigon at night has a charming neon vibe." width="1024" height="684" />

Anyway, late night was reserved for relaxation and hanging out with AJ before we depart for Cambodia. Tomorrow, we are finally jumping in the saddle for Cambodia!

		<Excerpt>Today, we are finally crossing the border to Cambodia. On the other side of the border, an unpleasant surprise is awaiting us!

		<Content><![CDATA[I and Antonio woke up earlier today, as we have to exchange Dong to USD and make maintenance on his bike. We left the bike at the Xe May and continued with my bike through the crazy traffic of Saigon to Ben Thanh. Around the market, there is a gold shop which is essentially an exchange shop. After getting USD for our trip, we stopped at one Banh Mi stall by one of the busy streets.

There, we had some awesome Banh Mi for 30k VND, with eggs, chili and soy sauce, and more meat! This Banh Mi was served by a woman who is seemingly pregnant, assisted by her daughter. Seemingly unnoticeable, a big problem in Vietnam is <strong>'child assistance'</strong>.

To earn more money from their local food businesses; parents usually do not send their children to school because they need a helping hand, which essentially robs them of proper education.
<h2>Packing up and Ready to Go!</h2>
Now that we have returned to the apartment, it was time to say pack up and depart for Cambodia. AJ came around to wish us luck and we were on our way! We decided to slice the route to Phnom Penh in half and stay in Neak Loeung. <img class="size-large wp-image-5053" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.biker_.jpg" alt="The biker crew is ready to hit the road to Cambodia!" width="1024" height="576" />

<div class="image_description">Channeling positive energy for the trip!</div>
Riding out of Saigon wasn't such a breeze. It is a huge city with 8 million registered inhabitants, so traversing on the main roads there is really chaotic. Lots of trucks and cars block out the way for the bikes, creating labyrinthian alleyways inside one huge road. When we finally got out of Saigon, we were greeted by heavy rain and storm which prompted us to stop before Cu Chi Tunnels.

<em><strong>Fun fact:</strong> Cu Chi is a place where you can visit the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Củ_Chi_tunnels"><strong>Cu Chi Tunnels</strong></a>, that were built during the French Colonial period, but also were used in the Vietnamese War.</em> After eating some much-needed food and drinking coffee with free tea (and hitting my head on the low ceiling numerous times), it was time to continue to Meo Vac border pass. <img class="size-large wp-image-5058 aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20190729_165626.jpg" alt="Just at the right place to wait out the heavy rain!" width="1024" height="576" />
<div class="image_description">Just at the right place to wait out the heavy rain!</div>
<h2><strong>Moc Bai Border Crossing</strong></h2>
Once we arrived at the border pass it all went like a breeze! At least on the Vietnamese side. You park your bike in front of the processing building. You give your passport for the exit stamp, walk to the security officer that will check the stamp, and you're free to go to the Cambodian side of the border. Things are a bit different on this side of the border.

First thing, you will be greeted by a few men who claim to be visa officers. They will look for your passports and fill out the form for entrance into Cambodia. Visa costs <strong>35$</strong>, while the processing fee (after handing out the pictures) is 5$. So, the tourist visa for 30 days stay in Cambodia costs 40$. The procedure for getting the stamp is really easy, you just walk in the building, hand out the passport, and off you go!

Oh, we made a little mistake and left the helmets to the 'visa officers' to look out for. When we wanted the go, one of the men didn't want to give Antonio's helmet back. He said he wants 10$ for coffee. In the end, we gave him 90k VND (which is almost 4,5$) and off we go! Remember to bargain in scam situations too! And watch out where you leave your things, to avoid these kinds of situations!

<em>Make sure to check out our <a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/visa-run-vietnam"><strong>Vietnam visa run guide</strong></a> for more information on border passes!</em>
<h2><strong>Officially in Cambodia!</strong></h2>
Once we passed the border town that has a huge casino, we realized the difference between Vietnam and Cambodia. The road here is very, very bad; lots of dust, no pavement and lots of holes. This can be an overkill for an automatic motorbike. Also, this road feels like Wild West, at one point there was no right side of the road. Everyone was just buzzing in their spots. Eventually, we stopped on the road to ask for gas. A whole family popped out of their home and were staring at us with huge curiosity. They gave us a few liters of gas (1$ for 1 liter) and we were on our way to Neak Loeung. We were immensely hungry on our way there and stopped at one family roadside restaurant. When we got there, it was really hard to communicate what we want to eat. At first, we got beer; after trying to communicate with at least 3 more people, we managed to order rice, vegetables, and beef combo. A guy who spoke good English helped us a bit too on that front. After refreshing for the rest of the trip, we continued to Neak Loeung. So, the <strong>language barrier in Cambodia is a thing</strong> too; it is a smart thing to learn some basic phrases for ordering food and drinks. <img class="size-large wp-image-5055 aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0815.jpg" alt="Cambodia has dogs on every corner." width="1024" height="684" />

<div class="image_description">Offerings to the shrine.</div>
The road to Neak Loeung is dark, with no lighting except the motorbike light. Of course, there are a lot of holes and flies flying straight into your head, but the helmet visor does a good job on that front. Cars and trucks drive like crazy, and noticing them shouldn't be a huge problem. On the way to Neak Loeung are a few villages that we're sleeping in this time of night.

As the ride was already taking us 9 hours, we stopped for an occasional break to stretch out. At one of such stops, a small snake popped out under Antonio's bike and wouldn't move. As Antonio has a sort of snake-o-phobia, he jumped away from his bike.

Eventually, we managed to scare away the snake with a few rocks and continue to Neak Loeung. After some 10 and a half hours of riding, we finally came to our accommodation. I was extra tired, so I just blacked out in my bad. Lovel and Darian had a very, very fun night...

Tomorrow, we are continuing our ride to Phnom Penh!

		<Content><![CDATA[I slept really well after the first slice of the road in Cambodia. Almost half a day to be more exact! Pulling down the curtain of the room provided an amazing view of the Mekong lowlands where this village is located. Some local children are playing in the little scrapyard behind the guesthouse. A moment later, they are chased away by an angry man working here. <img class="size-large wp-image-5069 aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0829.jpg" alt="Pulling down the curtains provided an amazing view!" width="1024" height="684" />

We got the message from the host that the check out time is at noon and that we will need to pay extra for checking out later. <strong>A smart notice:</strong> <em>always check with your host when is the check out time, so that you don't need to pay an extra fee.</em> Riding out into the town was a profound experience. The ambiance looks like I've been transported a decade or two in the past. Some scenes remind of a Wild West ambiance.

Dusty roads and wooden houses further enhance that vibe. Ordering food from the locals here is wonky if you don't know the phrases. Also, the locals love to group up and just stare at us and make unknown comments. It's a fun experience! <img class="size-large wp-image-5077 aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20190730_143840.jpg" alt="Neak Loeung main square is by all means patriotic." width="1024" height="576" />
<div class="image_description">Neak Loeung main square is by all means patriotic.</div>
It is good to remember that in the rural part of Cambodia, English is not spoken that much; so it is essential to learn a few Khmer phrases! After managing to order some tasty food, we found a place to sit and drink coffee. The coffee place also looks very run-down, like a saloon; but the warm smile of the beautiful lady makes up for it. And the coffee is awesome too!

After relaxing and observing the flow of the market in front of the saloon, we went to the gas station to fill up our bikes. <img class="size-large wp-image-5079 aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20190730_151354.jpg" alt="Observing the flow of the Neak Loeung market." width="1024" height="576" />
<div class="image_description">Observing the flow of the Neak Loeung market.</div>
Buying at the local gas station can be a chore, as there was no specified price on board, so the vendor could put out the price he wished. The thing is, you need to bargain in this situation if you don't want to get ripped off (compared to the more 'modern' gas stations). <img class="size-large wp-image-5078 aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_20190730_161126.jpg" alt="Bargaining at the gas station." width="1024" height="576" />
<div class="image_description">Bargaining at the gas station.</div>
Finally, after filling up our bikes with much-needed gas, it was time to ride the second slice of the path to Phnom Penh. To exit the town, we had to pass the longest bridge in all of Cambodia, spanning 2 kilometers.

We stopped for a while an awed at the majestic Mekong River and the surrounding coastline. Words cannot express how beautiful a sight that is! <img class="size-large wp-image-5080 aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_7874.jpg" alt="Staring into the flow of the majestic Mekong." width="1024" height="768" />

Fast forward 20 kilometers, we stopped at a roadside restaurant to get a refreshment and a warm meal. Finally, we managed to communicate with a lady that we want beef and rice. Inside a restaurant was an ecstatic old man who recognized Croatian football players. He said that 'Kampuchea and Croatia friends forever!'. A really warm welcome.

He was even escorting us to our bikes just across the restaurant and gave us each a hug. We continued to Phnom Penh afterward. <img class="size-large wp-image-5085 aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.IMG_7890.jpg" alt="Zen atmosphere in the restaurant." width="1024" height="768" />

<div class="image_description">Cambodian locals strolling on the highway.</div>
Some 15 kilometers in front of Phnom Penh, there were finally some lights on the road! Also, the road boosted in overall quality too! Can't say about the traffic through... Even though the people obey the traffic rules here more than in Vietnam, the traffic is very chaotic once the tuk-tuks and cars start popping in.

Anyways, we settled down in Okay Guesthouse and decided to take a walk around Phnom Penh at night. The guesthouse is just between Wat Bokun Park and the riverside. We started our walk on the riverside, which is a pavement along the Mekon River coast. It looks well-designed, is relatively clean, and it attracts a lot of people wishing to relax by the Mekong.

It also attracts a lot of street food stalls, one of them was selling fried bugs and frogs! We tried a few of them, but for me, it is a one time try! What I like about Phnom Penh is the vibe you can feel in the air. It has that laid back, relaxing aura flowing right through it that I just couldn't notice in Saigon. Maybe, that's because of the time constraint, who knows?

But, the riverside also surprised me by how clean it is. We walked to the center to Happy Pizza Place. Happy Pizza is popular around Cambodia for cannabis. They make pizza and put cannabis on it, giving you a mellow high at best. We ordered 2 small ones that cost about 6$ and enjoyed every bite of them.

Just type in 'Happy Pizza' in Google Maps once you're in Phnom Penh and you will find some places where you can order this kind of pizza. You can also score Cambodian Bush there, the price is as low as 1$/g. (the quality translates to that amount too!) After getting slightly hammered by pizzas, we went back to our guesthouse through the relaxing Wat Bokun park and went to sleep.

Tomorrow, we will explore more of what Phnom Penh has to offer for us!

		<Content><![CDATA[It was a bit challenging to sleep today, as we went to sleep at almost 5 AM. Just beside our room window, construction work is taking place. All kinds of noises that make it harder to sleep well. In the end, we woke up at 2 PM. <img class="size-large wp-image-5094 aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0853.jpg" alt="Construction work taking place just beside our guesthouse." width="1024" height="684" />
<div class="image_description">Construction work taking place just beside our guesthouse.</div>
We decided to ride to the Central Market, the biggest market in Phnom Penh. It is located inside and on the outskirts of an X-shaped building that looks simply majestic! It's like a little city inside.

You can find fresh food, clothes, jewelry, accessories and more things of your liking. I presume that you could spend an entire day at the Central Market and still not see everything on offer. <img class="size-large wp-image-5096 aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0866.jpg" alt="The exterior of the Central Market." width="1024" height="684" />

As we were very hungry, we were mainly looking for food. We found a little stall that was making some killer baguette sandwiches with papaya salad and skewer beef meat. You can also make the sandwiches yourself. Delicious!

After devouring the Num Pang sandwiches, we set off on foot to find someplace to drink coffee. <img class="size-large wp-image-5100 aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0886.jpg" alt="Delicious seafood is everywhere!" width="1024" height="684" />

Oh, I almost forgot! On the way to the Central Market, Antonio and Darian got pulled over by the police for speeding on the red light. In Vietnam, this wouldn't be a problem. Apparently, in Phnom Penh, traffic laws are reinforced if not for a sweet little bribe.

The police officer asked the guys 10$ each and let them go. Cruising around Phnom Penh on foot is highly enjoyable. Of course, you need to watch out for numerous tuk-tuks breezing through the streets, but the vibe is extremely relaxing. Feels a lot like Vietnam, but noticeably more undeveloped. <img class="size-large wp-image-5104 aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0916.jpg" alt="A very busy intersection and a crumbling building." width="1024" height="684" />

<div class="image_description">A huge building towering above the chaotic street.</div>
The garbage situation is no different. There are walls of garbage in some streets, and the waste disposal infrastructure is flawed at best. In the end, this garbage gets dumped near the Mekong or gets burned at designated places. Not the best way to go. After a long walk, we finally managed to find a coffee place, where we sat down and learned a few Khmer phrases.

Here are some of them:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>soos-a-day</strong> - hello</li>
 	<li><strong>lee-hi</strong> - goodbye</li>
 	<li><strong>sai-koo</strong> - beef</li>
 	<li><strong>sek-muan</strong> - chicken</li>
 	<li><strong>bai</strong> - rice</li>
 	<li><strong>aw-kon</strong> - thank you</li>
</ul>
Riding back to the guesthouse, it was already rush hour. And I must say, the traffic is crazy during this hour. Lots of cars and tuk-tuks make for some skill development in maneuvering through the labyrinths they make. The traffic doesn't flow like in Saigon because of that. We relaxed at the guesthouse a bit, then walked to the Happy Pizza place, this time, full small pizza for everyone! Fun times! <img class="size-large wp-image-5108 aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0959.jpg" alt="A Cambodian young man smiling for the camera!" width="1024" height="684" />

		<Content><![CDATA[The sleep tradition continues to this day too, as we woke up at 1 PM, feeling a bit sleep-deprived. Our plan for today was to check out the National Museum which is very close to our guesthouse, and Wat Phnom, the place where Phnom Penh came to be, the only hill in the city. After snatching some awesome Pad Thai at the street food stall, we continued on to the national museum.

Once you come inside, you will see a huge red building with ancient markings and statues. Really beautiful architecture. <img class="size-large wp-image-5116 aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0017.jpg" alt="The delicious Pad Thai!" width="1024" height="684" />

<div class="image_description">Streets in Phnom Penh usually have distinctive vibes. It is really enjoyable to just sit back, relax, and observe!</div>
The <strong>entrance fee to the National Museum is 10$</strong> with an optional 5$ fee for an audio guide. I would say, take the audio guide too, because I didn't take it, and most of the things were without captions.

The museum is full of ancient statues and carvings. Inside the museum, there is also the largest hand weaved scarf in the world! Anyway, I wouldn't say that this museum is worth 10$ if you go in without the audio guide. <img class="size-large wp-image-5129 aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0078.jpg" alt="An elephant guards the entrance to the National Museum." width="1024" height="684" />

<div class="image_description">The garden area of the National Museum radiates with a zen vibe.</div>
After exploring the National Museum, we rode out to the Wat Phnom. It is located in the northern part of Phnom Penh, on the hill that is circled by a big roundabout.

The <strong>entrance fee for foreigners is 1$</strong>, but it is totally worth it. This place is really chill, a huge park in the middle of the city, and a nice little relaxing hike. <img class="size-large wp-image-5120 aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0122.jpg" alt="The entrance to Wat Phnom." width="1024" height="684" />

<div class="image_description">An intricately designed Khmer carving.</div>
On top of the hill, there is a pagoda and a huge white stupa. Of course, out of respect for Buddhist customs, you need to take off your shoes before entering the pagoda. Inside the dimly-lit pagoda, there are a lot of offerings to the Buddha statue and the scent of burning sticks is really relaxing. It makes you stop for a while and just enjoy the moment. <img class="wp-image-5122 size-large aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0137.jpg" alt="Inside the Wat Phnom pagoda.

After enjoying the zen atmosphere of Wat Phnom, it was time for some dinner. We found a place to get a snack before going back to the hotel. After doing a bit of work, it was time for another slice of dinner. We decided that we check out the nearby roadside market. In the end, I lost the crew and cruised around the neighborhood. I found a nice street food place with some killer Num Pang! (baguette sandwiches).

Eventually, we met up at the same place and had an awesome dinner. After the regular dinner, we went to the Happy Pizza place to eat 'happy' dinner and drink some fresh beer. Tomorrow, we will check out the S-21 and the infamous Killing Fields, to circle out our visit to Phnom Penh.

		<Content><![CDATA[Today, we woke up at noon. The biorhythm is slowly going back to regularity I guess! After packing up for the rest of the day, we set off to find a place for breakfast (or lunch!). We found a nice, partially westernized restaurant called Meeting Place. I ordered Lok Lak, a rice dish with beef slices with some sweet chili sauce. It is delicious for the low price tag of 1,5$ - 2$. Also, the rain started pouring pretty hard, transforming us 4 in green, blue and pink raincoat ninjas! <img class="size-large wp-image-5137 aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0243.jpg" alt="Lok Lak is not as light as most dishes in Cambodia." width="1024" height="684" />
<div class="image_description">Lok Lak is not as light as most dishes in Cambodia.</div>
After some difficulties with the GPS, we finally found the Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum or S-21. Before venturing inside, we waited for the rain to stop in the coffee place just opposite the museum. Once you pay <strong>5$ entrance fee</strong>, you're free to explore the whole museum grounds. You can also pay an <strong>additional fee of 3$ for an audio guide</strong>.

This place was an elementary school before the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khmer_Rouge"><strong>Khmer Rouge</strong></a> regime. During the second half of the 1970s, Cambodia was ruled by a totalitarian regime that abolished money, possessions, education; and removed the people from the cities to working fields, where they were forced to work 18 hours, without pauses and with 180g of sticky rice to eat in two days. <img class="size-large wp-image-5154 aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0255.jpg" alt="The 10 commandments of the S-21." width="1024" height="684" />
<div class="image_description">The 10 commandments of the S-21.</div>
This regime was responsible for the vanishment of 25% of the Cambodian population (7 million was the total population at that time). Much of the former schools were used as prisons to torture people, most of them innocent people and children too.

This place is one of them. Here, the people who were thought to be an enemy of the regime were tied up to beds and tortured daily. <img class="size-large wp-image-5138 aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0276.jpg" alt="The first section of Tuol Sleng is full of haunting rooms where the prisoners were tied to their beds." width="1024" height="684" />
<div class="image_description">The first section of Tuol Sleng is full of haunting rooms where the prisoners were tied to their beds and tortured.</div>
Mostly, these people didn't know why they had come here and what had they done, so they were tortured just more. Most of the people here died of starvation, as they were tied up, and were allowed to eat their feces, nothing more. <img class="size-large wp-image-5139 aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0289.jpg" alt="Most of the beds in Tuol Sleng have a lock, symbolizing the hardships of the prisoners there." width="1024" height="684" />
<div class="image_description">Most of the beds in Tuol Sleng have a lock, symbolizing the hardships of the prisoners there.</div>
In one room, there are hundreds of photos of the victims of this S-21 jail. It was depressing to see the hopeless looks on the faces of people on the photos, especially children. <img class="size-large wp-image-5156 aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0304-e1568200262398.jpg" alt="Just 2 prisoners the S-21 has took out of estimated 20,000 prisoners." width="684" height="1024" />

There are a few survivor stories on display that show that the Vietnamese came marching to Phnom Penh to 'liberate' Cambodia from the cruel Khmer Rouge regime. Artists were kept alive because they had to paint portraits of KR leaders. <img class="size-large wp-image-5157 aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0306.jpg" alt="Haunting remnants of a former classroom." width="1024" height="684" />
<div class="image_description">Haunting remnants of a former classroom.</div>
Anyway, we took our time here at the S-21. It is an extremely depressing, yet educative place, and I think that it is important to know what happened to the people here in recent history to understand why their country felt behind so much. <img class="size-large wp-image-5140 aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0321.jpg" alt="Wired fence was used to contain the captives from attempting to escape, mostly by jumping to their suicide." width="1024" height="684" />

We didn't have time to visit the Killing Fields, as they are outside the city. But, we had arranged a free Mekong River Cruise with our guesthouse, so that was our next stop. It starts at 5:30 PM and lasts 2 hours. We were in a huge rush but eventually reached our ship. The cruise was simply amazing.

Observing the sunset and the skyline of the city while slowly sailing through the huge Mekong River. There was also some local Cambodian music, which sounded nice; and of course, food and drinks! <img class="wp-image-5142 size-large aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0380.jpg" alt="Roneak Ek, producing Khmer tra(n)ditional music, was a soothing accompaniment to the Mekong River cruise." width="1024" height="684" />

<div class="image_description">Mekong River slices Phnom Penh on two islands.</div>
We also sailed through some really dirty riverside villages. I saw that they throw the trash in the river or burn it on the shores. That just showcases the problem of waste management in Cambodia and the lack of education regarding it. <img class="size-large wp-image-5144 aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0430.jpg" alt="One of the numerous shore villages in Cambodia." width="1024" height="684" />

When the night comes, the Phnom Penh skyline becomes a light show. After 2 hours of cruising, we were immensely hungry and eager to find some street food. <img class="size-large wp-image-5146 aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0481.jpg" alt="Phnom Penh provides a colorful ambience at night." width="1024" height="684" />

Afterward, we returned to our guesthouse. I worked on my deadlines, while the others went to the massage. Today, it is time to go to sleep earlier, as the ride to Siem Reap begins tomorrow!

		<Excerpt>We’ve slowly started moving towards Kampong Thom from busy Phnom Penh. The ride was pleasant, but the road and traffic were chaotic. Check out our Cambodian motorbike adventure.</Excerpt>

		<Content><![CDATA[Today is our last day in Phnom Penh. We are starting our ride to Siem Reap. The decision was made to slice up the road to Siem Reap in half, staying in Kampong Thom for a night or two. We checked out of Okay Guesthouse and were ready to tie up some loose ends. Before setting off for Kampong Thom, we visited Happy Pizza.

There, they serve some killer fruit shakes for just 1$. After devouring the banana shake and doing the resupply, we finally set off from Phnom Penh! <img class="size-large wp-image-5163 aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0484.jpg" alt="Devouring a banana fruit shake to fill up for the road ahead!" width="1024" height="684" />
<div class="image_description">Devouring a banana fruit shake to fill up for the road ahead!</div>
Well, getting out of Phnom Penh is such a breeze compared to Saigon! On the outskirts of the city, we found a street stall that was serving various skewers combined with papaya salad. It was a nice meal, even though it had some fish sauce inside. When you're hungry, your expectations drop, and that is okay.

A few kilometers down the road, we found a nice coffee place to energize and relax before the chaotic main road kicks in. The road to Kampong Thom is 170 km long and goes exclusively on National Road 6.

This slice of the road amazes with its scenery of rice paddies, and the lowlands stretching into infinity, with palm trees randomly popping up on the canvas. <img class="size-large wp-image-5168 aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0541.jpg" alt="Wonderful sunset just elevates this seemingly infinite stretch of rice paddies scenery." width="1024" height="684" />
<div class="image_description">Wonderful sunset just elevates this seemingly infinite stretch of rice paddies scenery.</div>
Of course, as this road connects Siem Reap and Phnom Penh, it is quite busy. Lots of fast driving trucks, cars, and buses that sometimes push you off the side of the road when they pile up one after another. <img class="size-large wp-image-5169 aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0516.jpg" alt="The traffic on this main road can elevate to crazy levels!" width="1024" height="684" />

<div class="image_description">Yes, even bicycles are often part of the traffic on this main road!</div>
Riding for more than 2 hours on a scooter with a travel bag on the bag will require you to stretch here in a while. On one such stretch pause, we discovered banana chips! They are quite delicious!

We also filled our gas tanks at the roadside multi-purpose stall, took some photos with the family owning that stall, and continued our ride. <img class="size-large wp-image-5166 aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0536.jpg" alt="A lovely Cambodian family posing for the photo!" width="1024" height="684" />

<div class="image_description">Darian joins the photo session with the Cambodian family!</div>
After a 4 hour ride, we finally arrived in Kampong Thom! We unpacked our stuff in a spacy room that is full of cockroaches. The town square is just out of the side street our guesthouse is, where it is still busy after 9 PM.

There are a lot of local food stands to offer fruit shakes and rice meals. We found a local restaurant on the backside of the square, that served some great rice and beef combo. After dinner, we ordered some beers and went to the square statues to relax a bit. On the way to our guesthouse, we noticed a huge KTV building at the beginning of our street.

KTV is essentially a karaoke bar, but once you go inside, you realize that it walks the line between karaoke bar, hostess bar, and a brothel. We asked the manager about the price of the room, which is 10$ for 1 hour of karaoke.

After getting the information, we returned to our guesthouse. The night was reserved for reflection time on the balcony, where we could also observe the local life. The area around KTV is constantly busy, with locals driving off ladies all the time. There is also a wild dog pack that howls in the early morning and are quite wonky when it comes to crossing the road.

One such dog almost got ran over by locals on a motorbike. Anyway, after a night of observation, it is time to rest for a while. Tomorrow, we will explore Phnom Samui, a hill some 20 kilometers away from Kampong Thom. <em>To get up to date, <a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/day-9"><strong>check out the previous chapter!</strong></a></em>

		<Content><![CDATA[Today, I woke up a bit earlier to be able to work a bit for my client. Before starting with pure productivity, I relaxed on the balcony, observing the flow of life in the neighborhood. Locals tend to their gardens and go to the market on their motorbikes. In the distance, a Buddhist chant can be heard via a megaphone. Probably prayer time for local monks. <img class="size-large wp-image-5191 aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0562.jpg" alt="The view of the neighborhood." width="1024" height="684" />

<h2><strong>Preparing for the Hike</strong></h2>
Anyways, after doing my work, I ventured to the gas station to fill up the juice on my bike for the upcoming day trip. While waiting for Antonio and Lovel to finish their bike check at the mechanic shop, I got off to explore the area across the bridge. There is a nice little riviera here that is quite relaxing. <img class="size-large wp-image-5190 aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0582.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="684" />

<div class="image_description">Stung Sen River flows through Kampong Thom.</div>
After the guys were done with their bike checks, we cruised around the local town market to find something to eat. The market is full of fresh fruit, vegetables, and the fresh scent of seafood, of course! We found a place to eat but didn't know what to expect. At most street food stalls, you can see what is being cooked, so you know what to expect. I picked a soup with beef skin that had a really bad taste that almost got me in a nausea state.

I managed to eat almost all of it in the end, but wouldn't say that I would try this meal again. Fish sauce in a soup with beef skin is not such a great combination. <img class="size-large wp-image-5192 aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0588.jpg" alt="The busy main street." width="1024" height="684" />
<div class="image_description">The busy main street.</div>
We also found a comfortable coffee place that is a movie theater at the same time. Well, not your classic movie theater as there are three TV screens, one showing WWE wrestling, one showing a Korean kung-fu movie with Cambodian dub, and one that is showing Cambodian news. <img class="size-large wp-image-5189 aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0790.jpg" alt="The comfy coffee place feels like a cinema." width="1024" height="684" />
<div class="image_description">The comfy coffee place feels like a cinema.</div>
After sipping our coffee, we rode back to prepare the gear for our day trip to Phnom Santuk.
<h2><strong>Ready for the Hike</strong></h2>
The ride to Phnom Santuk is a relaxing one, as there was not a lot of traffic en route to the hill. On the way, we lost Antonio and Darian. After waiting for 10 minutes, I and Lovel decided that we continue without them, as they knew where the location is and would go up the hill with their motorbikes, rather than hiking on foot. Sliding off the main road into the dust trail through the rural part of Cambodia is amazing.

The bypassing people look at you with huge smiles and spread the positivity around. After getting closer to the hill, we were stopped by a local man who was selling tickets.

The <strong>entrance fee to Phnom Santuk is 2$</strong>, and the hike is totally worth it. To the left is the vehicle route to the hilltop, while on the right is the route to the village where the hiking route to the hilltop begins. We proceeded that way and were welcomed by a local kid who gave us the parking spot for 50 cents each.

The raindrops could be felt a bit, but nothing too detracting from the hike. <img class="size-large wp-image-5193 aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0599.jpg" alt="The entrance to Phnom Santuk hike." width="1024" height="684" />

<div class="image_description">You get greeted by amazing views of the lowlands below on the way to the top.</div>
There are <strong>800 steps</strong> to the top of the hill. The steps are very steep, and it is a bit tiring to get to the top. On the way to the top, there are some amazing viewpoints over the lowlands below, and you can even see the glow of Tonle Sap in the distance! Macaque monkeys start showing up more frequently as you are reaching the top. The sounds of the tree leaves indicate that they are jumping around. The macaque monkeys are usually not harmful to humans if not provoked.

They can be pretty territorial, asking for a snack before letting you pass. The macaques live in a matriarchy, with the mother being bloating huge and caring for its young ones. Make sure that you don't provoke the mother alpha by provoking her children, as the monkeys will then turn their attention to you. <img class="size-large wp-image-5197 aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0635.jpg" alt="Once you get closer to the top, more monkeys start to appear!" width="1024" height="684" />

<div class="image_description">A small macaque awaiting guests at the entrance.</div>
Anyways, the hilltop is really zen. <strong>Lots of monkeys</strong> running around the numerous shrines and golden stupas, while feeling the scent of the burning sticks in the air. <img class="size-large wp-image-5179 aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0668.jpg" alt="A shrine that radiates with tranquil energy." width="1024" height="684" />

<div class="image_description">Yellow candle wax symbolizes the enlightenment of the Buddha.</div>
We sat down for a bit to relax from the hike and observed the young Buddhist monk below us. He got his sugar cane juice stolen by a sneaky monkey, so he was throwing rocks on him. It can be seen that he means them no harm, as he was throwing rocks at the safe distance from the monkeys. <img class="size-large wp-image-5180 aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0689.jpg" alt="Sneaky macaque ready to get his hands on some juice!" width="1024" height="684" />
<div class="image_description">Sneaky macaque ready to get his hands on some juice!</div>
We found Antonio and Darian relaxing on the rock that is an awesome viewpoint on the Cambodian lowlands. The monkeys soon came swarming the rock, so we slowly made our way to the next spot. After taking a green pause for half an hour, the sun has slowly started to fade. <img class="size-large wp-image-5182 aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0719.jpg" alt="Amazing viewpoint on the lowlands dominated by a mountainous backdrop." width="1024" height="684" />

<h2>Returning to Kampong Thom</h2>
The night was inevitable. As I and Lovel were on foot, we decided that we should start our descent before we get cast up in darkness. The monkeys started their descent too, and these are very territorial!

They blocked the stairs, so we began our descent down the road that is made for vehicles. The darkness eventually swallowed us, but the numerous fireflies lighted the way for us. Also, there are a lot of small bats that just love flying into my hair! Eventually, we found the village in which we parked our bikes and set off to Kampong Thom! The road back to the main road is shrouded in pitch-darkness and unpaved.

But, it is absolutely amazing to hit the off-road and see that this bike is reliable enough for this. On the main road, we stopped at the roadside restaurant for some rice, vegetables and chicken combination and a few beers that lifted our spirits up. As our muscles were really tired and sore after the hike, when we returned to Kampong Thom, we decided that we should find a massage place.

First, we looked around our neighborhood but found out that most of them are closed at 10 PM. Eventually, we found a massage place on the northern side of the river that cost 5$/1 hour Khmer massage. Khmer massage is similar to Thai massage, a bit rough and painful in some parts, but gets the job done. Also, no oil!

The massage begins with leg and foot massage, then continues to the arm and hand massage before transferring to the back.

The back was the most painful one. For the end, head massage and neck massage really closed off the deal nicely. Beautiful Khmer girl did the job well and after the massage session, I felt really clear in my mind and body. It was also a fun experience, as this lady was teaching me some Khmer words during the massage. After the massage, we relaxed a bit on the balcony before going to rest. Tomorrow, we will explore the jungle temples around Kampong Thom!

		<Content><![CDATA[Getting some good night's sleep was crucial after an awesome hike we made yesterday. I managed to wake up at the same time as Antonio, and we decided to cruise around the town. We found a little street workout park in a chill location by the river and did light training after a while. <img class="size-large wp-image-5210 aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0775.jpg" alt="Some street workout in the morning is a must!" width="1024" height="684" />

<div class="image_description">The Stueng Saen riverside.</div>
After the training, it is time to fill up with some calories. At the town square, there is a street food stall that makes nice fruit shakes. The scent of Durian can be strongly felt around the stall, so it was reasonable to try out a fruit shake with Durian, combined with bananas.

It is a delicious combination! Also, really cheap noodle soup with chicken! After the meal, we prepared for temple exploration with some local coffee at the 'cinema' place. Finally, we are ready to hit the road to the jungle temples! <img class="size-large wp-image-5212 aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0794.jpg" alt="Ready to hit the road to the jungle!" width="1024" height="684" />

The jungle temples are 20 km northeast of Kampong Thom. The first part of the road to there is quite decent until you hit the villages. The road there is driveable but full of holes. Amazing scenery though! Also, riding through the rural area is special.

People will look at you with beautiful smiles and wish you a good day most of the time when you pass around them. <img class="size-large wp-image-5215 aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0809.jpg" alt="A man doing the field work with a motocultivator." width="1024" height="684" />

<div class="image_description">A beautiful road section awaits on the final stretch before the jungle.</div>
After a while, we got to the Tamon Temple and walked around the beautiful jungle a bit. These temples are older than the temples in the Angkor Wat complex, but not as majestic. <img class="size-large wp-image-5221 aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0968.jpg" alt="Arrived to the first temple, Tamon Temple!" width="1024" height="684" />

<div class="image_description">Rice paddies just outside the jungle.</div>
The other temples are located deeper in the jungle. We passed through a ticket checkpoint, but there was nobody around, so we just continued to enter the jungle. This was our first jungle ride in Cambodia and it is amazing! Once we were hitting the muddy roads, we knew we were on the right track! Hindu temples are scattered all around this jungle, showing up with their mystical appearance in the dense jungle.

We also found an abandoned treehouse village near the river. <img class="size-large wp-image-5225 aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.DSC_0034.jpg" alt="You will be tempted to stop here in a while and absorb all the energy around you!" width="1024" height="684" />

After taking our time diving into the jungle and the mystic remains of a long lost civilization, the dark was near. We quickly rode away from the jungle, backtracking through villages in pure darkness. At one point we saw a peculiar sight. A drunk father is trying to hold onto his bike while his young son was following him with a cow beside them.

They probably had a long way to go. On the way back to Kampong Thom, we stopped at a random roadside restaurant where we ate some epic baguette sandwiches with beef skewers, all served with papaya salad and hot chili. One slightly drunk man made us at home with his toasts and lots of beer.

We also learned him our toast phrase: 'Živjeli!'. It was a really lovely random little moment. After devouring the sandwiches, we continued to Kampong Thom. A

fter getting back to our guest house, I felt the tiredness from the jungle combined with a mellow beer influence. After that, we had a long, long night that was fueled by many beers.

I can only say that this was definitely one of the most fun and weirdest nights in Cambodia so far! <em>To get up to date, <a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/day-11"><strong>check out the previous chapter!</strong></a></em>

		<Content><![CDATA[Da Nang, a pearl of Central Vietnam, is an attractive vacation destination as the city features endless sandy beaches, stunning mountains, delicious traditional food, vibrant local community, and affordable prices. The city has undergone a rapid development boom that started roughly 10 years ago and, by stories from locals, Da Nang is a completely different city now. If you're planning to visit Da Nang anytime soon, but you're short on time, then our 3 days in Da Nang itinerary is for you.
<div class="single_post_info_box"><i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle fa-2x"></i> <strong>A few notes before starting:</strong> Please keep in mind this itinerary is solely based on our subjective experience of Da Nang. We give our best to provide you with a balanced itinerary, so everyone can enjoy and explore the beauty this city has to offer. Last but not least, we're going to start straight with the itinerary for each day following with details such as transportation, food, prices, and accommodation.</div>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>3 Days in Da Nang Itinerary - Balance Between Local and Tourist Experience</strong></h2>
Da Nang, as the pearl of central Vietnam, is regarded as the most livable city in Vietnam. Most people spend only a day or two at most in Da Nang while missing out on the beautiful things the city has to offer. I've been traveling around Da Nang and Quang Nam province multiple times before deciding to move here to live. During that time, I've put a lot of energy and time into exploring every corner of the city and its surrounding area to get a better understanding of people and culture.

It's a very tough task to create a one-fits-all itinerary, so I tried to create a balanced 3 days in Da Nang itinerary here. If you're looking for a tailored Da Nang itinerary, we can help you create one that suits your preferences and budget.

<h3><strong>Day 1 - Jungle Exploration &amp; Food Heaven</strong></h3>
<img class="wp-image-5286 size-full aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5da4586e815c3.jpg" alt="Sunrise on the My Khe beach" width="1025" height="590" />
<div class="image_description">Sunrise on Son Tra Peninsula, <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/138100930@N04/35860629610/in/photolist-6PhxAF-qfwstJ-o6pSLP-6Q9Cip-qfvzds-o2vgjD-bNzfm2-6NQ51E-qDc4vo-6NQ6uW-6NQ9Zs-bzECrC-bzEBoJ-bzEzCf-bNzeY8-bzEAZw-bNzeFn-bNzcWg-bNzgpT-bzEv43-bNze14-mNkAPv-WCT6Pq-gNbUEj-gNcV5c">Le Anh Tuan</a></div>
I can't recommend more waking up early and heading to My Khe beach to enjoy the breathtaking sunrise. If you're an active type then you'll definitely fell in love with the vibe of My Khe beach in the morning. People, young and old, go out for a morning physical activity and socializing. Running, or simply walking along the beach while observing stunning sunrise can't be a better way to start your first day in Da Nang.

Jump to the ocean for refreshment, take a shower and start the exploration. Since you've already started off your day with physical activity, hiking and exploring beautiful nature is a thing I'd recommend. Hiring a scooter for a three-day stay is the right thing to do if you have a <a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/vietnamese-driving-license"><strong>proper driving license</strong></a> and driving experience.

Head over to Son Tra Peninsula and enjoy stunning beauty overlooking the bustle and hustle of the city.
<p id="fIGqgIT"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5301 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5da462d733a3e.jpg" alt="Linh Ung Pagoda" width="1003" height="725" /></p>
We have a comprehensive post about <a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/son-tra-peninsula"><strong>things to do in Son Tra Peninsula</strong></a>, so it's a great start to plan your trip there. As for highlights, I would mention Linh Ung pagoda, driving to the old Banyan tree and slowly progressing to Ban Co Peak. For a proper exploration of Son Tra, you can expect to <strong>spend at least 4 - 6 hours in the jungle</strong>.

Also, the sunset is amazing when observed from Ban Co peak or in front of Linh Ung pagoda. Once you're done driving around Son Tra, you'll probably feel drained, so what could be better than a good treat with Vietnamese food? A seafood lover here? Just follow the main road down the Son Tra and you'll be soon driving on Hoang Sa beach road. On the right side, you'll see many seafood restaurants filled with locals.

Go there and order some of the most delicious, freshest, and arguably the best seafood in Da Nang. If the seafood isn't your thing, then head to Châu Thị Vĩnh Tế street for diverse Vietnamese cuisine.

Literally, you can find almost all kinds of Vietnamese traditional food in tiny local restaurants or street food stalls. Happen to prefer western food after an exhaustive day?

Head over to the An Thượng Night Market where you can enjoy western delicacies such as pizza, hamburgers, tacos, sausages and similar.
<p id="fPWCEFT"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5302 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5da463e927d64.jpg" alt="Han River Da Nang, Vietnam " width="1178" height="659" /></p>
Once you feel like you've eaten enough, the good thing would be to relax with a glass or two of craft beer. Head over to <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/7bridgesbrewingco/">7 Bridges Brewing Company</a></strong> and enjoy the taste of their diverse craft beer selection. From there, I recommend two options - heading over to Han River pubs and enjoy commercial music, not so lively nightlife and beautiful views, or heading over the more relaxed area for some live music, good conversations, and cheap beers.

The majority of pubs are located on a Bach Dang street just after you pass Dragon Bridge and it's might be a suitable place for a pub crawl. For relaxed bars and atmosphere, I recommend visiting <a href="https://www.facebook.com/heavenbar47/"><strong>Heaven bar</strong></a> or <a href="https://www.facebook.com/crazycatcoffeepub/"><strong>Crazy Cat</strong></a> where you can feel a community and expats sharing ideas while listening to creative music and enjoying sips of local beer.

Whatever option you choose, it's a great way to finish off your first day in Da Nang, get some sleep, and get ready for the day to come.

<strong>Day 1 Summary:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>watch the sunrise at My Khe beach</li>
 	<li>drive around Son Tra Peninsula (Linh Ung Pagoda, Banyan Tree, Ban Co Peak)</li>
 	<li>eat fresh seafood at beach restaurants near Son Tra Peninsula</li>
 	<li>enjoy craft beer with stunning views at 7 Bridges Brewing Company</li>
 	<li>do a pub crawl or relax in expat area</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Day 2 - Market Hustle &amp; Marble Mountain</strong></h3>
<p id="aWXCJzd"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5300 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5da4621414cc9.jpg" alt="Vietnamese food market" width="1074" height="709" /></p>
Feeling a bit hungover or tired from yesterday? Head over to Bac My An market for a heavy treat. It features a diverse selection of traditional food including all types of noodle dishes, affordable fruit shakes or juices and the iconic avocado icecream! If you're looking for souvenirs or clothes, there is also a clothes market next to the food stalls where you can find interesting deals.
<div class="single_post_info_box"><i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle fa-2x"></i> <strong>Rule of thumb:</strong> Always negotiate prices when buying goods on any Vietnamese market. What strategy I've found effective? For the majority of goods, cut the asking price by 70% and start negotiating from there. People will usually settle at 50 - 60% of a starting price. It's not disrespecting to bargain and local sellers love to engage in the good negotiation process. Also, knowing a phrase or two on Vietnamese can land you a better deal.</div>
After a good treat, it's time for a <a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/vietnamese-drip-coffee-guide"><strong>traditional Vietnamese coffee</strong></a> at a traditionally looking cafe called <a href="https://www.facebook.com/trinhcaphedn/"><strong>Trinh Cafe</strong></a>. I personally like that place since it's looking like cafes in Vietnam during the 70s, has a thuốc lào (Vietnamese tobacco bong), and a great selection of drinks. Another similar place that comes to my mind is <a href="https://www.facebook.com/NAMhouseCoffee/"><strong>Nam House</strong></a> that's located on the other side of the city and it's very popular among the local hipster scene. If you're looking for a nice talk with young locals, then heading over to Nam House might be a great option. <img class="wp-image-5297 size-full aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5da4602dd8761.jpg" alt="Marble Mountain Da Nang, Vietnam" width="971" height="601" />
<div class="image_description">By <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/guerretto/14968807899/in/photolist-oNK45P-fV25Rq-o4ZAWj-226yaRc-Jw5dVp-23q9r8N-dr4k7e-dsQcWK-dsQufC-pvkzPH-oNp19D-p5RTsL-dsQ6bt-oNpjyW-DNYcEB-oNoSqH-p5CHA6-oNp6nz-DNYiuc-rgtHTh-p3RZb5-p3S1iL-23sStUT-p5RT9E-oNoW8c-oFxSH3-p3RVpC-p5RKwW-oNoXii-oNp8jm-22oeD29-oNpBzY-p3S3wd-p3RRzd-pRxdmZ-oNp7uf-p5RKT7-po3UqD-9x6dmn-S86Z6W-oJeKPF-p5CEjB-oEtk8G-oJeHxM-MxwqKc-FzwPQe-pRBt3G-MpgHm7-oNpNYP-oNoZBr">Guerretto</a> - Marble Mountain, Da Nang, Attribution 2.0 Generic (CC BY 2.0)</div>
Once you're done with a coffee and you feel at your peak again, I recommend driving to Marble Mountain. It's a limestone mountain that features a few Buddhist temples, caves, viewpoints and lots of stairs. It's such a great workout that rewards you with stunning views over the city and the beach. The entrance fee is <strong>40,000 VND and expect to stay there for about 2 hours</strong>.
<p id="BGLIgGy"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5298 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5da461315ddeb.jpg" alt="At the top of Hai Van Pass" width="1002" height="741" /></p>
After you're done with the exploration of Marble Mountain, you'll definitely feel exhaustion and pain in every part of your body. The best way to avoid soreness is by jumping in the ocean on the My Khe beach and enjoy the vibe with sips of delicious coconut juice (around 30,000 VND). From there, I'd recommend two ways - either drive to the top of Hai Van Pass for the extremely beautiful driving experience or simply get to a rooftop bar and enjoy cocktails with a beautiful sunset in sight.

If you decide for later, then I can't recommend more <a href="https://www.facebook.com/2mai0103/"><strong>Alacarte Hotel</strong></a> and its rooftop on the 24th floor.

They have a <strong>happy hour from 3 - 6 pm each day offering two beers for 80,000 VND total</strong>. Once the sun sets behind the horizon, it's time to refill your energy with a nice bowl of Bún thịt nướng or Banh Xeo. Head over to Pham Cu Luong street and get into one of the local Banh Xeo restaurants.

Don't forget to order plenty of Nem Lui and a few cans of local Larue beer.
<p id="xNOgxKN"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5299 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5da461a43ec5e.jpg" alt="Dragon Bridge in Da Nang" width="1072" height="709" /></p>
If your second day in Da Nang falls on the weekend, then don't forget to watch a Dragon Bridge show that starts every Saturday and Sunday from 9 pm. A dragon from the bridge spits fire and water and it looks nice, but if you're like me and you don't like overcrowded places then you'd probably not enjoy it. Head over to Cau Nguyen Van Troi bridge (out-of-traffic-bridge next to Tran Thi Ly bridge) and enjoy beautiful Dragon Bridge show from a distance with fewer people and local vibe.

It's probably around 10 pm now, and you've been around for the whole day. Go back to your hotel, relax a bit and take a sleep since you'll need that energy for the last day in stunning Da Nang.

<strong>Day 2 Summary:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>enjoy traditional Vietnamese food and My An Market + get some souvenirs and clothes</li>
 	<li>drink traditional coffee and Nam House or Trinh Cafe</li>
 	<li>explore Marble Mountain</li>
 	<li>get some drinks at a rooftop bar and enjoy the sunset</li>
 	<li>experience a Dragon Bridge show on the weekend</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Day 3 - Day Trips From Da Nang</strong></h3>
<p id="PUNotCp"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5292 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5da45dd726ae6.jpg" alt="My Son Ruins in Quang Nam" width="1075" height="711" /></p>
For the third day in Da Nang, I would recommend taking a day trip out of the city and visit beautiful and historic places. One historic place is called My Son and it's located in a neighboring Quang Nam province around 50 km out of the city center. The ruins are a heritage of the Champa empire where you can wander around a cluster of abandoned, and not so preserved Hindu temples.

The entrance fee is <strong>150,000 VND and you can visit temples every day from 6:30 am - 5:30 pm</strong>.
<p id="qxzYPrs"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5293 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5da45e6a65090.jpg" alt="Ba Na Hills" width="1141" height="709" /></p>
The second option would be visiting popular Ba Na Hills and iconic Golden Bridge that gives its visitors really beautiful views of the surrounding area and, on clear days, a whole Da Nang city. The ride to Ba Na Hills is simply amazing featuring stunning landscape and wide road.

Expect to pay <strong>700,000 VND for the entrance fee</strong> that covers cable car, all attractions and much more. Personally, I don't like Ba Na Hills so much since it's an overcrowded place and the majority of photos you see on Instagram are heavily edited.
<p id="OxAazjX"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5296 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5da45f7c327ef.jpg" alt="Hoi An Ancient Town" width="1182" height="776" /></p>
The last but not least would be visiting a charming ancient town of Hoi An that is located just about 35 km south from Da Nang. Getting to Hoi An is pretty straightforward - just follow the beach road and eventually you'll end up in a small and crowded town. Walk around the ancient town, enjoy delicious food on the food market, enjoy the countless rivers, take a boat tour, get a tailored suit (or Ao Dai) are just some of the ideas you can do in beautiful Hoi An.

If you decide to visit Hoi An at night, I can't recommend more to book a night in a local homestay. The mornings around the ricefields are simply amazing since you'll be gifted with stunning sunrise and observation of locals' lifestyle.

<strong>Day 3 Summary:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>visit Ba Na Hills or</li>
 	<li>visit My Son in Quang Nam or</li>
 	<li>explore beautiful Hoi An and book a night in a homestay</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Getting To &amp; Around Da Nang</strong></h2>

Since Da Nang is the 5th biggest city in Vietnam and annually hosts more than 8 million tourists, the tourism infrastructure is very developed. Getting to and around the city is convenient, efficient and affordable:
<ul>
 	<li>domestic or international flight</li>
 	<li>bus</li>
 	<li>train (recommended if you're traveling from Hue)</li>
 	<li>motorbike (don't miss Hai Van pass)</li>
</ul>
The international airport is located literally in the city's center and only 5 km away from My Khe beach. Grab is a popular and affordable option to get out of the airport. Depending on your destination, you can expect to pay around 100,000 VND for a Grab drive + 10,000 VND for car airport fees.

If you're traveling from the north, you can consider getting a train from Hue to Da Nang via Hai Van Pass. It's arguably the most scenic train ride in a whole Vietnam since train passes around stunning Hai Van. Always book your train ticket in advance since this particular line is usually booked. You can expect around 3 hours of driving so we recommend booking a soft seat.

The prices for a one-way train ticket is around 150,000 VND. For more information about tickets, check out <strong><a href="https://12go.asia/en/train/hue/da-nang">12go Asia website</a></strong>. For people who travel from south, Hoi An is just about 40 km away from Da Nang and you can rent a motorbike, taxi, or take a bus. The whole ride won't take more than one hour.

Hiring a taxi from Hoi An to Da Nang costs from <strong>300,000 - 500,000 VND</strong>. The advice is to always call an official taxi number to <a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/scams-in-vietnam"><strong>avoid common taxi scams</strong></a>. For budget travelers, a direct bus line is by far the best option.

The bus costs <strong>30,000 VND and drive lasts for 50 minutes</strong>. The line operates every day from 5:30 am to 6 pm (buses every 20 minutes).

Don't forget to plan your visit carefully, since Da Nang officially has two seasons. The prices vary a lot as well as weather, so be sure to check <a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/best-time-to-visit-da-nang"><strong>what is the best time to visit Da Nang</strong></a> before.
<h2><strong>Where to Stay - Accommodation Options &amp; Prices</strong></h2>

<div class="image_description">A stunning view from the rooftop at Fedora Hostel</div>
There are so many accommodation options while traveling to Da Nang. It really depends on your preferences and budget. You can choose between budget hostels, beautiful beach bungalows all the way to luxury hotels, and high-end resorts. We stayed in <a href="https://www.facebook.com/fedorahosteldn"><strong>Fedora hostel</strong></a>, a very comfortable hostel that features capsule beds.

The staff was very friendly and helpful, the rooms were clean, the beds were more than comfortable, and they also offer a free breakfast (6 meal options). One night costs <strong>around 90,000 VND</strong> and it's located just next to the airport. Probably the best feature of the hostel is a spacious rooftop with stunning views of Son Tra mountain, Hai Van Pass, and whole Da Nang city.

Before booking the place, be sure that you've checked <a href="https://www.booking.com/"><strong>Booking.com</strong></a> and <a href="https://www.agoda.com/"><strong>Agoda</strong></a> since the prices usually differ from platform to platform. You can get a very nice discount on Agoda for high-end hotels.
<h2><strong>What to Eat in Da Nang?</strong></h2>
Vietnamese cuisine is extremely diverse and you'll notice a slight difference in traditional food once you start traveling around the country. Da Nang was formerly a part of today's neighboring province Quang Nam which is known for a crazy amount of delicious food. While exploring Da Nang and its surrounding area, be sure that you give your body enough nutrients to keep your energy high.

Here are a few local delicacies you have to try while in Da Nang. We've got lucky to talk with a few travelers who've shared their favorite Vietnamese street food.

Feel free to check out the list of <strong><a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/vietnamese-street-food">Vietnamese street food</a></strong> you have to try.
<h3><strong>#1- Mì Quảng</strong></h3>
Mì Quảng, originating from a central Vietnamese province Quang Nam, is one of the favorite noodle dishes among travelers and locals. It's recognized by its mouthwatering taste around the country, so it's not surprising locals eat Mì Quảng on important occasions such as Tet holiday, death anniversaries, or family parties.

The base of this iconic dish is rice noodles mixed with meat (or seafood), different types of fresh herbs, and just a bit of turmeric-infused broth for extra taste. Locals usually use cilantro, onion leaves, and basil for a herb mixture.

On top of that, expect a nice amount of freshly fried peanuts and rice crackers. <img class="wp-image-5288 size-full aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5da45a0816892.jpg" alt="A bowl of Mi Quang" width="997" height="667" />
<div class="image_description">A bowl of delicious Mi Quang.</div>
We did try recommended restaurants to find out they serve mediocre Mì Quảng at the best. Since Antonio has a girlfriend who's a local in Da Nang, he decided to seek for an authentic local bowl of this iconic dish. There are two places we really enjoy eating our Mì Quảng:
<ul>
 	<li><a href="https://www.foody.vn/da-nang/mi-quang-ga-xuan"><strong>Quan Mi Quang Ba Xuan</strong></a> (a completely local place near the airport and a bit on city outskirt)</li>
 	<li><a href="https://www.foody.vn/da-nang/dac-san-mi-quang-dung"><strong>Mi Quang Dung</strong></a> (a tiny restaurant in a heart of touristic An Thuong area)</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>#2- Bún Thịt Nướng</strong></h3>
If you're a barbeque and peanut e.g. peanut butter lover, then a bowl of fresh Bún thịt nướng is a dish you're looking for. It's a popular dish around central and south Vietnam, and luckily, Da Nang features one of the best bowls of this iconic dish around its streets. The bowl contains vermicelli noodles topped with fresh herbs (mint and basil), green salad, bean sprouts, peanuts, and cooked peanut sauce.

Usually, a delicious and still hot BBQ meat is added along with fish sauce for extra taste. People usually add chili and garlic for an extra treat. Be careful as this dish will make you full without even realizing it. <img class="wp-image-5289 size-full aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5da45ae2168b8.jpg" alt="Bun Thit Nuong" width="966" height="642" />
<div class="image_description">By <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/loustejskal/28422843001/in/photolist-nT4z2R-8EXQ8G-2fEugV9-zkJEd4-258x272-2fK9SDr-ji5Vur-Attd74-c5Gwgs-6FFD1B-awSnfG-3cAvsf-rT1nKW-mBr4yN-4JzSzd-dr5FmB-KiCuva-7AmBiL-KiCtHP-KiCuZg-2hers8n">Lou Stejskal</a> - Attribution 2.0 Generic (CC BY 2.0)</div>
If you're on the beachside, head over to Pham Cu Luong street (just a first big street on the left after crossing Tran Ti Ly bridge). There is no specific place we can recommend since the whole street features at least three Bún thịt nướng (and Bánh xèo) places next to each other.

The interesting thing is that you'll hardly see a foreigner there while locals usually make these tiny restaurants full.

Expect to pay <strong>20,000 - 30,000 VND</strong> for a big bowl of this fulfilling dish. <strong>p.s.</strong> friendly advice is to order Nem Lụi (a grilled meat sausage on a stick) and add it to the combination.

Thank us later! ;)
<h3><strong>#3- Seafood</strong></h3>
Once in Da Nang, you simply can't skip a seafood tour! Da Nang is probably the most popular place for eating fresh and diverse seafood in a whole country. Seafood restaurants are often packed till the last seat during almost every night since it's rooted deeply in the Danangese culture to drink while enjoying a table of freshly prepared seafood.

Once you hit the My Khe beach and walk on Vo Nguyen Giap road, you'll see many seafood restaurants. These restaurants have solid and diverse menu, but it comes with a price since these places are mainly visited by tourists from China, Korea or Japan. If you really like the ambient, but the prices are bit too high, just continue following the road to Son Tra (north) until you reach Hoang Sa road.

There you'll find many seafood restaurants filled with friendly locals and better prices. Looking for an authentic local experience? Head over to another side of the city and stroll through Duong Nguyen Tat Thanh street. The whole street features stunning views over the local beach and Hai Van pass as well as many seafood restaurants filled with local people.

For a nice seafood dinner for 4 people, you can expect to pay from <strong>500,000 - 1,000,000 VND (if you include drinks)</strong>. Enjoy!
<h3><strong>#4- Bánh Xèo</strong></h3>
Bánh xèo literally translates to sizzling pancake and the name literally explains this iconic dish. If you're a pancake lover you'll probably ask where the sizzling comes from. Once the rice batter is thrown in hot oil on a skillet, the sizzling sound is very loud and that's where the name comes from. The base of a pancake is made from a mixture of rice flour, turmeric powder, and water.

Depending on a restaurant, people usually mix it with small shrimps, different types of meat, beans and bean sprouts. It's usually served with mint, basil, and lettuce.

Also, you'll get a small bowl of hot peanut dipping sauce which just goes great with Bánh xèo. <img class="wp-image-5290 size-full aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5da45bd1206c1.jpg" alt="Banh Xeo" width="980" height="642" />
<div class="image_description">By <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lwy/48715904932/in/photolist-fAMgXy-duiJGy-dukMXw-nEehkT-6DVfPr-C78thY-4r5q9f-rAucbE-duidsh-224k2a8-7mhBEC-H7K5ER-ori2vS-pn5Lm8-dukPWY-ducD2a-duiUSA-dukKgC-ducQAM-dukwyb-dui35L-dudrn6-duiMuW-p1DzQa-6A3kAq-oL65jw-d7iXph-Ewco4-duiSE5-mBQu9K-mBQsxt-FGYRwq-oaqDHG-7TBzrY-6zYeYp-7Tyfxi-oZXXK2-28xhsMp-R4H8Vx-LkHppn-2hervSX-2hervQT-2hespFx-2hervLu-2hdRKio-2hdr9Uh-2hdr7tv-2h9Xwh4-2gnmkuD-xr21ok">LWYang</a> - Attribution 2.0 Generic (CC BY 2.0)</div>
There are countless Bánh xèo places in Da Nang, but only a few worth mentioning. Head over to Pham Cu Luong street (same as if you're looking for a bowl of Bún thịt nướng) and enjoy very delicious Bánh xèo. Another very busy and popular place for enjoying delicious Bánh xèo is <a href="https://www.foody.vn/da-nang/banh-xeo-ba-duong"><strong>Banh Xeo Ba Duong</strong></a>. Prices for a portion range from <strong>20,000 to 50,000 VND</strong>.
<h3><strong>#5- Chè</strong></h3>
Once you've finished with heavy and tasty lunch, what would be a better treat than having a traditional Vietnamese dessert - Chè. This iconic desert relates to any sweet Vietnamese dessert such as soup or pudding. Chè is usually made from a mixture of frozen beans, peas, kidney beans, different types of jelly, pieces of fresh fruits, coconut cream, and sweetened condensed milk.

Expect a sugar rush and sensory overload since Chè usually contains more than 10 different flavors in one cup. There are multiple street stalls, especially during the night in Da Nang, but there is only one place worth mentioning. The name of a place is <a href="https://www.foody.vn/da-nang/che-xuan-trang"><strong>Che Xuan Tran</strong></a> located on a busy Le Duan street just next to Han Bridge.

The prices for Chè vary from <strong>10,000 - 20,000 VND</strong> depending on a number of flavors and fruits (Durian is more expensive but worth trying).

		<Content><![CDATA[Some souvenirs are simply not practical from a space-saving perspective and people started to look for lightweight and portable ideas. Are you thinking to bring traditional souvenirs from Vietnam back home but lacking original ideas? Don't worry, we get you covered. Buying souvenirs in Vietnam is a cultural experience that will introduce you with a diverse, vibrant, and rich Vietnamese culture and its regional differences.

You can relax in a hammock while an old Vietnamese lady with effortless hand moves makes your conical hat. Or, visit renowned silk tailors who can make any piece of clothing you can possibly imagine. Getting souvenirs will give you a detailed insight into people's lives, their struggles, their virtues, and the beauty and depth of their culture. We remember the struggle of getting souvenirs for friends and family.

Some items are too big or too fragile for flights, which makes them completely non-practical.

Here's the list of practical, traditional, and memorable Vietnam souvenirs you can buy around the country.

Let's do souvenir shopping together.
<h2><strong>#1- <em>Nón lá </em>- Vietnamese Conical Hat</strong></h2>
<img class="aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5da71015e1da5.jpg" alt="Vietnam Souvenir, Non La Hat" /> One thing you can hardly miss in Vietnam is their iconic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_conical_hat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">conical hat called <em>Nón lá</em></a>. Locals around the country (especially the countryside) wear <em>Nón lá</em> during the day to protect themselves from the sun or rain, depending on the season.

Did you know that the first appearance of Asian conical hats dates 3,000 years ago?

If you're looking to get <em>Nón lá</em> as a gift or souvenir, don't worry as you can find these hats everywhere. Locals usually use palm leaves and bamboo to make <em>Nón lá</em> hat.

It's interesting how styles differ depending on the region. For instance, in the northern province of Thanh Hoa, people tend to wear a hat featuring a wider frame, while Hue is famous for a thin leaf hat and Binh Dinh for extra small and thick hats.

The best place to get a traditional <em>Nón lá </em>would be Chuong Village that sits just about 30 km from the capital.

As we've already mentioned, people can find <em>Nón lá</em> on every step in Vietnam, so don't worry if you're not visiting villages or the countryside. A visit to any night market will present you with a vast variety of conical hats.

Prices in the market and touristic places vary - <strong>20,000 - 150,000 VND</strong> is what we usually see as the price tag. In the countryside and specialized local shops, the prices won't exceed 20,000 VND.
<h2><strong>#2- <em>Áo dài</em> - Traditional Vietnamese Dress</strong></h2>
<img class="aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5da7122bd1836.jpg" alt="Souvenirs in Vietnam, Ao Dai" /> <em>Áo dài</em>, a silk-made traditional long dress, is probably one of the most recognized Vietnam souvenirs you can find. The history of <em>Áo dài</em> dates back to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nguy%E1%BB%85n_dynasty" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nguyen dynasty</a> (19th century) who required court people to wear <em>Áo dài</em>. During a colonization era and 1950s, international designers saw massive potential in <em>Áo dài</em> and decided to create a modern, unisex dress that is known today as <em>Áo dài</em>.

If you ever find yourself wandering around the Old Quarter in Hanoi or the Ancient Town in Hoi An,  you'll see mainly Vietnamese women walking around wearing traditional <em>Áo dài</em> with different graphics, colors, and styles. When picking <em>Áo dài</em>, think about the contrast - trousers should contrast a dress color (see on the picture above - red/black combination).

The most popular place for tailoring <em>Áo dài</em> (and other clothes) to your size is Hoi An. Since the town became extremely touristic, prices of tailoring <em>Áo dài</em> climb through the roof, so don't forget to negotiate. People usually wear <em>Áo dài</em> during significant holidays, such as <a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/tet-holiday-vietnam" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tet Holiday</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-Autumn_Festival" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mid-Autumn festival</a>.

The prices for a tailored <em>Áo dài</em> usually <strong>start at 700,000 VND and can reach 2,000,000 VND</strong> depending on the fabrics, colors, graphics, and shop.
<h2><strong>#3- <em>Thuốc lào</em> - Tobacco Bong</strong></h2>
<img class="aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5da7126ec103f.jpg" alt="Thuoc Lao, our favorite Vietnamese souvenir" /> <em>Thuốc lào</em>, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotiana_rustica" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nicotiana Rustica</a>, is a particular sort of tobacco that contains up to 10 times more nicotine than the regular one. It's fascinating how a tobacco bong ritual can be found only in the northern provinces while it's tough to see anyone smoking <em>Thuốc lào</em> in the south. Locals love to get a nicotine hit from a bong after a big lunch accompanied by a cup of Vietnamese coffee and herbal tea.

Since tobacco is powerful, people usually feel dizzy or high after inhaling through the pipe. Never take massive hits from the beginning, but instead start small and slowly increase.

<em>Thuốc lào</em> is a term for unique tobacco, while a water bong is called Dieu cay or Dieu bat, depending on the material. As we've already mentioned, the best place to find a pipe and tobacco is Hanoi, Thanh Hoa (best tobacco by locals), and Nghe An provinces.

Prices may vary, but expect to pay <strong>around 200,000 VND</strong> for a bamboo or metal pipe and up to 700,000 for a wooden one (which might be harder to carry it back home since border regulations).
<h2><strong>#4- Traditional Vietnamese Coffee &amp; Coffee Phin</strong></h2>
<img class="aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5da712d077ed8.jpg" alt="Vietnamese coffee with a view in Laos" /> What would be a better souvenir from Vietnam than delicious and potent coffee? Did you know that Vietnam is the second-largest coffee exporter in the world? Well, that says everything about the <a href="https://vietnamchronicles.com/vietnamese-coffee-culture" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">coffee in Vietnam</a>. Once you set your feet in Vietnam, you'll see coffee everywhere. Locals are talking with sips of strong coffee and tea, a coffee scent on each step, and booming of cafe shops.

Coffee in Vietnam is rooted in culture. Vietnam mainly produces Robusta beans, but Arabica can be found in the Highlands, especially around Da Lat and Buon Ma Thuot, which is regarded as the capital of coffee in Vietnam. We recommend visiting local farms and families producing coffee in the Highlands if you're looking to bring coffee back home.

The prices from the farms usually start at <strong>100,000 VND for 200 grams</strong> of packed coffee beans. In the markets and shops (Big C, Vincom, locals markets), you can get Trung Nguyen for about 70,000 VND (350g).

Don't forget to get a coffee phin (filter) for about 30,000 VND that will make a <a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/vietnamese-drip-coffee-guide" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">delicious Vietnamese coffee</a>.
<h2><strong>#5- <em>Guốc Mộc </em>- Traditional Wooden Footwear</strong></h2>
Wearing wooden traditional footwear in Vietnam dates from Nguyen dynasty times when people started to wear <em>Áo dài</em>, <em>Nón lá</em> and famous <em>Guốc Mộc</em>. The beautiful and oldfashioned wooden shoes can be seen on Vietnamese women during special occasions such as the Tet Holiday celebration, Mid Autumn Festival, or similar.

The history of wooden footwear in Vietnam is fascinating since farmers were mainly working barefoot until the Tran dynasty in the 15th century. Did you know that indigenous people living in Cao Bang province (near China border) wear stone clogs? During the Nguyen dynasty, wooden clogs became mainstream footwear among wealthy people, and soon after August Revolution in 1945., the first factory for producing wooden clogs was opened in Hue.

The rest is history. Nowadays, we had a chance to see older women wearing <em>Guốc Mộc</em> while driving around Nghe An countryside. Apart from that, I've seen plenty of artistic traditional footwear in Hoi An during the Mid Autumn Festival (authenticity is questionable).

You can get your hands on wooden clogs around the Old District in Hanoi or Benh Thanh Market in Saigon or the Ancient Town in Hoi An.

You can expect to pay around <strong>250,000 VND</strong> in these touristic places for a pair of wooden clogs.
<h2><strong>#6- Silk</strong></h2>
<img class="aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5da715f709657.jpg" alt="Colorful Silk in Vietnam" /> Silk might remind you as a luxury, but the times when the elite and royal family only wore silk were far behind us. These days you can find loads of silk products, long dress (Ao Dai), shirts, and much more on the markets and stores. For instance, Hoi An is widely recognized by tailors who're going to make beautiful and elegant clothes from silk for your size.

Are you looking to buy high-quality silk in Vietnam? Head over to Silk Street (Hang Gai Street) in Hanoi's Old District, and you'll be surrounded by hundreds of small shops and silk vendors.

In Hoi An, there is a popular Cocoon Silk store that not only specializes in selling silk but also educates people about silk and its history. Other great places to buy silk are Cam Chau (Silk Village around Hoi An), and Toan Thinh Silk in Saigon.

Expect to pay around <strong>100,000 VND per meter of Vietnam silk</strong>.
<h2><strong>#7- Herbal Tea</strong></h2>
<img class="aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5da716902646b.jpg" alt="Vietnamese tea is a perfect souvenir" /> Did you know that Vietnamese tea is considered as a hobby of older people? You see, you can't miss getting some tea as a souvenir from Vietnam back home! There are many different types of tea consumed in Vietnam and the most popular are lotus, jasmine, and green tea. It's not surprising that wherever you go to Vietnam, you'll see people, young and old, enjoying green tea while socializing.

The best place to buy tea is by far Thai Nguyen province (around 150km north from Hanoi). If you don't go there, try your luck in Lai Cau or Da Lat.

Jasmine and green tea costs about <strong>50,000 VND per 100 grams, while Lotus tea can reach 1,000,000 VND for 100 grams</strong>. We bought a delicious tea (don't know what it was) in Trang An area (Ninh Binh province) from our guest house.

The tea was a mixture of many herbs, roots, and leaves, but the majority of people in that area consume tea like that. We remember it was the most delicious tea we've ever tried.

The price was around <strong>200,000 VND for around 100 grams</strong>.
<h2><strong>#8- Do Paper Postcards</strong></h2>
<img class="aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5da717063a40d.jpg" alt="Do Paper postcards" /> Do Paper is a particular type of paper made from the inner layer of do trees. This paper had a crucial role in Vietnamese tradition and history since the folk artists throughout history were painting the historical moments and events on this paper. Nowadays, do paper isn't widely used, but relevant documents, books, and valuable paintings are still printed on it.

The most famous art made on Do paper is by far Dong Go painting. Sometimes, it can be tough to find a store that sells do paper, but don't worry, we have you covered. Head over to Craft Link or small shops on Hang Gai in Hanoi's Old District.

There you can get traditional postcards, notebooks, shiny pictures, greeting cards, and much more for the price <strong>starting at 30,000 VND</strong>.

<strong>p.s. </strong>If you're looking for digitalized postcards from Vietnam, don't hesitate to check our <a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/postcards" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>postcard page</strong></a>.

Also, we're creating digital postcards on demand, in case you're looking for something creative and original. :)
<h2><strong>#9- Traditional Hand Embroidery</strong></h2>
<img class="aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5da717a0d3891.jpg" alt="Traditional hand embroidery" /> Hand embroidery is rooted in Vietnamese culture so deep that even Vietnamese ancestors liked to say:
<blockquote>
<h4><em>"Men read books and recite poems. Women have to do embroidery and sewing."</em></h4>
</blockquote>
You can find literally anything embroidered, including sheets, quilts, pillowcases, table runners, bags, sleep dresses, and much more.

The majority of embroidered products differ in prices, quality, and material, so pay extra attention while buying. For instance, locals tend to buy hand embroidery made from cotton or silk as they believe it's the best. If you're heading to Sa Pa or norther provinces where ethnic minorities live, be sure to take a visit around the villages and support their hard work. Embroidery from the north is arguably the best and most durable.

Buying embroidery in Hanoi is effortless and can be found around Hoan Kiem lake. Check out Hang Gai street and Hang Da Market (2nd floor) for creative handmade embroidery products.

<strong><em>Expect to pay up to 300,000 VND for bed sheets, up to 150,000 VND for a handbag and around 200,000 VND for napkins.</em></strong>
<h2><strong>#10- Traditional Musical Instruments</strong></h2>

Music plays a huge role in the life of the Vietnamese people. Once you stay in Vietnam for a while, you'll soon realize that almost anyone plays at least one musical instrument. I was positively surprised when walking through tiny streets in Hanoi or Da Nang and hear uplifting local music. People tend to gather, get tasty local food, and play guitars, and other musical instruments.

Also, they always encourage people to join them, so how to say no to that? During my time in Vietnam, I've learned to play the guitar and I actually bought one. You can find musical shops on each step, even in smaller places and the prices are reasonable.

I've got my first acoustic guitar (Chinese version) for around 1,500,000 VND (around $65) which is a nice deal. Anyway, chances you have someone in the family who's passionate about the music are high, so getting a musical instrument would be a nice gift from Vietnam.

<strong>The best musical instruments that go as handy souvenirs from Vietnam are:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>bamboo flutes (schoolkids usually play it!)</li>
 	<li>xylophones</li>
 	<li>miniature Trong Com (a colorful Vietnamese drum)</li>
</ul>
Since these instruments are made from different types of wood, be sure to check with your airline and immigration since some materials are restricted. I faced a problem of bringing a wooden Thuoc Lao (tobacco bong) when I was coming back to Croatia but was happy that my girlfriend could take it. When buying Vietnam souvenirs, the best places to check are the main local markets.

Each town or city has its market where you can find anything, from food and souvenirs, to live animals and motorbikes. You name it. If you're in Hanoi, head over to Dong Xuan Market. In Ho Chi Minh City (Saigon), you should go to Ben Thanh Market, while in Da Nang it's Han Market. For smaller places, just do a search on Google Maps and look for Chợ - a Vietnamese word for the local market.

The prices for musical instruments start at 30,000 VND and can easily reach 2 million VND. Always bargain!
<h2><strong>#11- Chopsticks</strong></h2>
<p id="PyHNxfb"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5911 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5e82461eaadf7.jpg" alt="You can't miss with chopsticks. One of the most authentic Vietnam souvenirs." width="1179" height="870" /></p>
Vietnamese food is extremely diverse, but rice stays staple food. If you've ever eaten with a Vietnamese family, then you know how much rice they eat. I've been living with a local Vietnamese family for more than 4 months, and I can't remember a single day without a bowl of rice. As a soup goes perfectly with a spoon, the rice goes well with chopsticks.

I don't know anyone who didn't start to use chopsticks on a daily basis after returning from Vietnam. You can't miss with a set of traditional chopsticks. You can find basic chopsticks at any local market for the price of 10,000 VND.

I've bought a whole wooden set (around 10 pairs) for about 20,000 VND. If you want to be fancy while eating, aim for metal chopsticks or the ones with the art such as dragons.
<h2><strong>#12- Vietnam T-Shirts</strong></h2>
I simply love Vietnamese t-shirts! Buying t-shirts is a whole experience for itself since there are so many options to choose from. While buying Vietnam souvenirs, you can't miss by getting one, or two or ten t-shirts. Since Vietnam is one of the biggest manufacturers in the world, it's not strange that the t-shirt market is enormous! You can find t-shirts in various colors, sizes, text, graphics, funny slogans.

During our last trip, we initially planned to spend around an hour at Ben Thanh Market in Saigon, but we stayed the whole afternoon. Be careful as your wallet will get smaller and smaller - it's addictive.

<strong>p.s.</strong> the prices vary, but I'd say an average for a printed t-shirt is about 100,000 VND. Don't forget to bargain as locals are masters in getting a better price from you.

<strong>Here are some of the best catches during our shopping:</strong>
<p id="oyLcEpB"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5912 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5e82476ee60bb.jpg" alt="Funny Vietnamese t-shirt vol.1" width="1263" height="912" /></p>
<p id="rDFLjfl"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5913 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5e8247a0ef86f.jpg" alt="Funny Vietnamese t-shirt vol.2" width="1226" height="923" /></p>
<p id="IJgldYt"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5914 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5e8247e66585c.jpg" alt="Funny Vietnamese t-shirt vol.3" width="1279" height="911" /></p>
We hope our list of 12 souvenirs from Vietnam will help you in deciding what kind of traditional product you'd like to bring home. There are still many other conventional products you can take as souvenirs, but we didn't mention all since some are too big or heavy to be practical for transportation. If you have any other ideas, feel free to share it with us. Enjoy Vietnam! ;)

		<Content><![CDATA[Nakai, one of the first places I've visited during my first Laos trip, instantly became my home where I've met my second family. At first glance, Nakai looks like a tiny village with not many interesting things to do, but after staying there for a month, I've had a chance to explore the beauty this place has to offer. You won't see many foreigners around, just a few who're doing a famous Thakhek loop since Nakai is one of the stops on the loop.

Locals are extremely friendly and you can hear <em>'Sabaidee'</em> followed with a beautiful wide smile on every step. I've been to Nakai twice and plan to visit this beautiful place many times in the future.

What's special about this tiny town in the middle of central Laos?

Let's check out the most amazing things to do in Nakai.
<h2><strong>#1- Enjoy Delicacies From Local Market</strong></h2>
<p id="yzjFAFe"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5437 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5dc18f9e7900e.jpg" alt="Sunset over a small local market." width="1064" height="783" /></p>
Lao people love to say if there is a market, it's a town. In the town center there is a small market where you can get various goods including fabrics, toys, candies, prepared meals, drinks, fresh vegetables, fruit and much more. Pretty much like any countryside market in Laos.

Oh not to forget, there is a non-recognizable bus station with daily lines to Laxsao (near Vietnam border) or Thakhek. A local market is one of the main drivers of the economy in Nakai.

I've tasted many delicacies on the market, but by far the most delicious are local-made meals. You have a few pots with a cooked dish, so you can pick whatever suits you.

Fried vegetables with beef is my favorite. Also, every food stand tends to have the same food, but sometimes the food differs in freshness, so I recommend not buying all the food from the same vendor.

That way, not only you're getting the freshest food, but also you're financially supporting more families.

You can't miss with fried chicken or liver on a stick and of course, a bowl of their sticky rice.

You can expect to pay 5,000 LAK for each dish, so I was spending about 20,000 LAK per day on food in Nakai (around $3).
<h2><strong>#2- Visit Open Nakai English School</strong></h2>
<img class="wp-image-5425 size-full aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5dc186bd250f6.jpg" alt="My students in Laos." width="1066" height="794" />
<div class="image_description">This was the picture from my last day in Laos with my students. I've had a chance to meet all of them on my second visit. Some of them stopped studying, some of them improved so much. I'm very happy for them and looking forward to seeing them again.</div>
The main reason I've found myself in Nakai, in the first, place was volunteering at Open Nakai English School.

The school started as the idea of a young and energetic man called Thon who've learned English while working in a local resort.

He recognized how many opportunities opened his way once he was able to clearly communicate in English, so he decided to start his own classes to teach young students English. When I've first arrived, I was stunned how much dedication this man has since, at that time, he was working three different jobs. His brother in law, Khen is the second teacher who focuses on teaching younger students.

They have a huge family and I can say they became my Lao family. We usually eat lunch and dinner together that features traditional Lao food including their staple, sticky rice combined with bamboo soups, diverse vegetables, fish, sometimes fried crickets, snails and ant's eggs. You can really experience a life of a local Lao family while staying with them and if you're doing Thakhek loop, be sure to check out his place.

<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/g49vdI2UMx0" width="764" height="430" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>

After the first visit, I wanted to introduce my Lao family to my girlfriend, so we visited my family again and had a blast. In case you'd like to experience teaching and living in the Laos countryside, <a href="https://www.workaway.info/en/host/988244659799">here</a> you can find a project on Workaway.

If you need any help or would love to hear more about the project, please don't hesitate to reach me out.
<h2><strong>#3- Try a Spicy Papaya Salad</strong></h2>
Whenever I asked my students about their favorite food, I've always got pretty much the same answer - spicy papaya salad. It's important to mention that Lao food is probably the spiciest food I had a chance to eat. They make everything extremely spicy and they love it! I've decided to try their specialty on the local market and I must tell it's very delicious...and spicy.

If you're not used to spicy food, tell a friendly lady who makes food to not put many chili peppers. After a while, I was eating papaya salad with more than 10 chili peppers inside. It's very funny how locals are very judgemental about the blend or mixture in papaya salad. It's the most important part, and the secret of delicious papaya salad since locals mix spices, herbs and sauces together.

The quantities and ratios are crucial to Lao people and after a few papaya salads, I could tell the difference between the blends.
<h2><strong>#4- Watch the Sunset From Ghost Boat</strong></h2>
<img class="wp-image-5436 size-full aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5dc18ed3d53c3.jpg" alt="Watching sunset at Ghost Boat." width="1062" height="795" />
<div class="image_description">I've found some beautiful girl and couldn't hesitate to take this photo.</div>
Sunsets in Laos are very special, unique and different. I had a habit of watching sunsets from different spots every day while I was in Laos. During my first visit (dry season) you couldn't see a single cloud in the sky and sunsets looked spectacular. In the low season, it's the same thing. Probably everyone who's ever been to Laos will say the same.

You simply don't want to miss a beautiful Lao sunset. One of the best places to observe the sunset in Nakai is from their Ghost Boat. During the high season, the sunk boat becomes a restaurant where you can order drinks, local specialties (papaya salad is very good there) and enjoy the sunset.

I recommend taking a seat on the top of the boat and ordering a cold Beer Lao while enjoying the sunset. Thank me later. :)
<h2><strong>#5- Boat Racing Festival</strong></h2>
<img class="wp-image-5440 size-full aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5dc1917812810.jpg" alt="Boat racing festival in Laos." width="589" height="506" />
<div class="image_description">A blue team preparing for the race.</div>
If you're visiting Laos in late September or early October, don't miss the chance to watch the craziness of the boat racing festival (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boun_Suang_Huea">Boun Suang Heua</a>). The biggest events and races take place in the northern city of Luang Prabang, but you can experience boat festivals around the villages and towns that sit on the Mekong river. During the boat racing festival, Nakai completely transforms from a laidback village to a dynamic place (in Laos countryside context) where local families are outside with their kids while getting involved in various activities.

There are many stands where you can buy imported and locally made goods, play some games, sing karaoke, try Laos delicacies, and of course, enjoy cold Beer Lao in huge quantities.

It's a two-day festival where locals form racing teams who compete against each other in boat rowing on the lake. The energy is simply amazing and you don't want to miss this festival.

Also, after the final race, there is a huge party in the form of a concert where locals have a lot of fun and way too many beers.

The funniest thing about partying in Laos is that people start very early, always bottoms up the beers and go home extremely early. <img class="wp-image-5438 size-full aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5dc19078327f9.jpg" alt="Nakai market during the boat racing festival." width="579" height="718" />
<div class="image_description">Strolling through the market. Khen is very funny with his umbrella, but it makes sense since it's crazy hot.</div>
The family and my girlfriend left so early, so I've decided to just enjoy and drink a bit more. Instantly, I've met a few local friends who were my dancing and drinking partners through the night.

Also, we didn't understand each other a single thing, but it was a great time! Oh yeah, not to forget, I was hungover for the following three days! :)
<h2><strong>#6- Swim Around Song Sou Waterfall</strong></h2>
<img class="wp-image-5430 size-full aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5dc18c2a9ef46.jpg" alt="Song Sou Waterfall" width="593" height="769" />
<div class="image_description">As you can see, the actual waterfall is a few hundred meters away from the lake.</div>
Song Sou waterfall is just 3 km away from controversial Nam Theun 2 power station and touristic (not so) visitor center. Before reaching the power station you'll encounter a small bridge with an unpaved path on the left and a sign to a waterfall. It's interesting that the Lao government started to 'invest' in tourism, so you can see a sign here and there leading you to an attraction.

Just follow the road for about a kilometer and you'll encounter a security guy who takes care of parking. The cost of parking is 5,000 LAK.

You have to walk for about 5 minutes until you reach a small lake where you can jump from rocks and swim. The waterfall is a bit behind and I've never gone near the waterfall since you have to climb and it's not the greatest idea to do it in flip flops.

Anyways, during my first visit in March, the stream from a waterfall was not existent and the lake was very low but still good for swimming.

It's a great place to enjoy the beautiful nature, get some sun or barbeque and enjoy swimming in a cold, but extremely clear water.

<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bCHI6tvEOrM" width="764" height="430" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>

One anecdote from my first visit. I was very scared to jump in the lake at first since every time you put the leg or arm in the water, there are hundreds of fish around. These fish are harmless, but the crazy amount of them just scared me off.
<h2><strong>#7- Go Camping</strong></h2>
<img class="wp-image-5441 size-full aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5dc1920ba2c80.jpg" alt="Camping in Nakai." width="1068" height="770" />
<div class="image_description">A camping site during the sunset.</div>
Nam Theun reservoir features a massive lake with countless beautiful places to camp. I've brought my tent from Vietnam, but there are a few rental options in local resorts. I recommend just going around the lake and find a suitable place for you.

You don't have to worry about the officials or other people since this area isn't densely populated, so if you set up your tent a bit away from the road, you'll probably see anyone around except fishermen driving their longboats. Be careful with the fire, especially during the dry season as everything is extremely dry and burns like crazy.

I've never experienced a campfire that big! Don't forget to take a mosquito repellent since you'll most likely be somewhere near the lake.

We were catching snails and eels during the night and prepared them for dinner on a fire. I really don't recommend doing it since snails can have different parasites that can be extremely dangerous for your body. I was very lucky that I've got not so serious form of parasites (Fasciola), but it made huge complications and scars on my liver.

Be extra careful about the food from the lake and drinking water in Laos.
<h2><strong>#8- Hike to Pha Katai Viewpoint</strong></h2>
<img class="wp-image-5432 size-full aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5dc18d2ee56ec.jpg" alt="Top of Pha Katai." width="1067" height="768" />
<div class="image_description">That's the view from the top of Pha Katai mountain.</div>
Around 25 km south of Nakai town, there is a beautiful limestone mountain just next to the river and the road. Pha Katai is the name of that mountain and you can climb using furnished metal steps all the way to the top where you can relax in a covered hut and enjoy stunning views. At the very beginning of a trail, there is a small house where you have to pay for an entrance.

The first time I've climbed, I paid 10,000 LAK and the second time they asked 20,000 per person, but since we didn't have a small change, they've let us climb for 8,000 LAK.

It means you can definitely bargain for the price since 20,000 sounds very expensive knowing that the majority of surrounding attractions cost less than 10,000 LAK.

There are around 700 steep red stairs that sometimes move while you're walking. It's definitely scary at some points. The whole hike takes about 20 minutes and it's definitely a great training. <img class="wp-image-5433 size-full aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5dc18db9d3cdb.jpg" alt="Stairs from Pha Katai." width="591" height="775" />
<div class="image_description">Infamous (not so red anymore) stairs.</div>
<h2><strong>#9- Nam Theun 2 Visitor Center</strong></h2>
Located just next to Nam Theun 2 Power Station, a visitor center shows the history of dam construction, relocations and positive results the hydro plant has on a community. It's very interesting to see how biased all the information is since they completely neglect the environmental effects, a negative impact on downstream communities, mighty relocation of indigenous people (around 7,000 people) and continual failure of elevating poverty.

If you're about to hit the Song Sou waterfall, then checking an <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Nam-Theun-2-Visitor-Center-506683322812427/">NT2 Visitor Center</a> should be on your list. It's pretty confusing when it comes to opening time as I've never had a luck to visit the center since it was always closed (even in the opening time?).
<h2><strong>#10- Wander Around Nam Theun Reservoir</strong></h2>
<p id="PdGkpQt"><img class="size-full wp-image-5439 aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5dc190c7173e1.jpg" alt="" /></p>
In 2008., during the wet season, the reservoir was created by flooding one of the latest remaining diverse jungles with a crucial impact on the ecosystem in central Laos. In the area of the current reservoir, more than 6,000 were forced to relocate to make the place for a gigantic dam project. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nam_Theun_2_Dam">Nam Theun Reservoir</a> is a massive lake and it's hard to see its end when you're wandering around.

If you ignore the historical facts and consequences the reservoir has on the environment and livelihood of locals, it looks spectacular! The very beautiful and at the same time sad feature is a dead forest that can be seen all around the reservoir. Currently, there are a few boat tours operating in the reservoir where you can experience the biodiversity that's left.

There are still many villages on the skirts of the lake that don't have access to basic infrastructures such as electricity, schools or roads. It's very awesome to see local communities adapting to a new lifestyle (it's discussable if it's a successful adaptation). I recommend you to sit somewhere near the lake during the sunset as that's the time the majority of fishermen come back home.

You can capture amazing shots during this time.
<h2><strong>#11- Explore Villages on the Way to Kong Lor Cave</strong></h2>
<img class="wp-image-5428 size-full aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5dc1899e6c9ea.jpg" alt="Villages on the way to Kong Lor Cave." width="1065" height="799" />
<div class="image_description">Kong Lor Cave in the distance. There is still more than 20 km to Kong Lor Cave that is located somewhere in the middle of mountains ahead.</div>
Kong Lor cave is an extremely popular destination for travelers who're doing Thakhek loop. It's located about 60 km from Nakai town and you can expect a real adventure driving a motorbike there. Prepare yourself for a rough and unpaved road that will lead you to the top of the mountain and then you'll slowly descend into the beautiful valley. On the way to the valley, there is a beautiful waterfall where you can rest a bit and simply enjoy the view.

A valley features numerous traditional villages where locals mainly live from farming, livestock, and logging. In the villages, you can stop for the food, but during my visit, I had a few bananas so I haven't stopped. There are many unpaved roads around so you can just get lost and wander around the beautiful place. The roads aren't marked on the maps, but you can navigate by locating the highest mountain (the one you've come from).
<h2><strong>#12- Climb the Orchid Path</strong></h2>
The Orchid Path is an off-the-beaten hike about 10 km north from Nakai, just next to the way to Kong Lor cave. The whole hike is about 900 m long and it will take about 20 minutes to reach the final viewpoint. Since this hike is just next to the main road, be sure to lock your bike properly. There is a security guy on the entrance, but don't rely much on him.

Once you reach the top, you'll be greeted with stunning views over the reservoir featuring countless islands, dead forests, and mountains in a distance.
<h2><strong>#13- Explore Resettlement Areas</strong></h2>
<img class="wp-image-5427 size-full aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5dc18866af774.jpg" alt="NT2 Resettlement area" width="1069" height="777" />
<div class="image_description">One of many resettlement villages around the NT2 reservoir. The road in the village (behind the table) is paved, but to reach the village, you have to prepare for an offroad adventure. :)</div>
Since the big flooding to make the place for a reservoir in 2008., more than 6,000 people were resettled to newly made villages with 'better' infrastructure. There are around 15 resettlement villages around the area that you can visit from Nakai town. I've visited a few since I was very curious about the life these people live nowadays.

It's true that infrastructure is better now since these people were living in the thick jungle and right now, they can reach Nakai and other towns through unpaved roads. The kids can attend the schools, but the problem is that the schools are far away and the transportation costs are high and usually unaffordable for an average family whose well-being depends on a depleting reservoir.

Despite difficulties, these people seem to live a very relaxed life enjoying a mid-day nap in their hammocks. Also, their smiles and friendly gestures were memorable. It's definitely my recommendation to visit at least one of these villages.

<hr />

As you can see, Nakai is a relatively small town in the middle of nowhere, but there are many beautiful things to do in Nakai. If you're doing Thakhek loop, be sure to stop, explore beautiful things around, enjoy spicy traditional food and share memorable moments with friendly locals.]]></Content>

		<Content><![CDATA[During our motorbike trip around Vietnam, I've instantly fallen in love with Da Nang. I remembered one night on the rooftop, my brother and I were daydreaming how cool it would be to live in Da Nang.

Fast forward a year, I've been living in Da Nang for a bit more than a year and I simply love this beach city. The relaxed vibe of locals, diverse cuisine, beautiful beach, and the surrounding area, affordable prices are just some of the things I love about Da Nang.

Nowadays, I see more and more expats deciding to move to Da Nang for longer periods and I'd like to share my experience when it comes to costs and quality of life in Da Nang.
<h2><strong>Cost Breakdown of Living in Da Nang as an Expat</strong></h2>
Before we jump into more details about the expenses of living in Da Nang, I would love to show you my average spending so you can get a rough idea of the budget and quality of life you get for your money.

I usually don't drink, but I'm not saving any money when it comes to coffee and other soft drinks.
<table class="danang_living_costs">

</table>
As you can see, on average, I spend roughly $900 every month. I'm spending more during the dry season (more electricity and water, slightly higher prices, etc.).

<strong>p.s. </strong>Please take my apologies for the ugly looking table! I hope you aren't so critical and it helps you with data. :)
<h2><strong>Affordable Accommodation </strong></h2>
Probably the first and the most important aspect of expat life is finding the right fitting apartment. Since Da Nang is going through the crazy development phase, construction sites and new hotels/motels (Nhà Nghỉ) are everywhere. It has its good and bad sides.

The choices are endless, but it comes with the constant construction noise which is sometimes overwhelming. <img class="size-large wp-image-5485 aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.apartment-in-danang.jpg" alt="My apartment in Da Nang" width="1024" height="768" />
<div class="image_description">This is my small apartment in the An Thuong area. It's a loft with a bed and TV upstair and a small bathroom behind the curtain. I have everything I need here for around $250/month.</div>
I'm living in an Airbnb room on the beachside - An Thuong area. The monthly rental costs me roughly <strong>5 million VND (around $250)</strong> with all utilities included. It's a good bargain for the area, but it comes with some downsides such as small space, no cleaning services, construction sites around, etc. Anyway, I've been staying there for more than 6 months and I'm pretty happy with it. The main advice when it comes to apartment-hunting is to rent for a few nights to check it out first.

I've met many expats who've rented the apartment at first sight and ended up being surrounded by mighty karaoke bars and construction sites. Check Airbnb for the potential prospects, book a few nights and see it yourself.

<em>There are also various Facebook groups where Vietnamese people post different apartment prospects each day, so it might be a great lead:</em>
<ul>
 	<li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/79917573655/">Da Nang Hoi An Expats</a></li>
 	<li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/danangrent/">Da Nang Apartments &amp; Rooms</a></li>
</ul>
Just write a post about your needs and budget and soon your inbox will be full with offers from agents. From my experience, the prices on the beachside for a <strong>single-room apartment/studio average from $200 - $450/month</strong>. In the Hai Chau district (on the other side, or riverside) the prices are slightly higher. Probably the cheapest option is to connect with expats and figure out a shared house.

<h2><strong>Food Heaven</strong></h2>
Da Nang offers a lively and diverse food scene where the choices are endless. There are various traditional dishes originating from central Vietnam that you can find on the streets in Da Nang. In general, there are three options for eating: western restaurants, street food and cooking your own food. <img class="size-large wp-image-5494 aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.rice-buffet.jpg" alt="Vietnamese street food" width="1024" height="768" />
<div class="image_description">This is a rice buffet you can find around the city. You get a plate of rice and then you pick the food. For a huge meal, you can expect to pay up to 30,000 VND.</div>
Local Vietnamese food is extremely fresh, delicious and affordable. For example, Bánh mì (sandwich with eggs and meat) costs around 15,000 VND, a bowl of Phở around 30,000 VND, a rice buffet (Cơm Bình Dân) will set you full for about 25,000 VND. A huge meal with a drink on the side won't exceed 50,000 VND.

It's important to mention that local food isn't vegetarian-friendly, but there are options. Look for 'Chay' places which means vegetarian food. I've found a very nice vegetarian rice buffet in An Thuong area that will set you for 25,000 VND.

Western restaurants are way more expensive and I've found out the food isn't that fresh. Some people would argue about the cleanness of street food compared to restaurants, but I've never had a single health problem with street food (knocking on the table). <img class="size-large wp-image-5488 aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.food-local-market.jpg" alt="Mi Quang on Han Market" width="1024" height="768" />
<div class="image_description">This is a delicious Mi Quang from Han Market in the process of making. It's an iconic dish from Central Vietnam (Quang Nam province).</div>
If you decide to cook your own food, you can't miss with local markets. Local markets feature friendly vendors selling the freshest ingredients for affordable prices.

It's crucial that you know the average prices for the food since sellers will usually charge you more for ingredients than usual. You can always negotiate about the prices, especially if you know the average price which will help you not losing the face and being disrespectful.

Locals love a good round of bargaining. I love to go for grocery shopping at My An market or Han market. You can find many souvenirs, clothes, kitchen things, traditional cuisine, and more there. <img class="size-large wp-image-5492 aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.local-market-in-danang.jpg" alt="Local market in Da Nang" width="1024" height="609" />
<div class="image_description">Getting lost around the local market in Da Nang. You can buy literally anything here, but be ready for bargaining!</div>
<h2><strong>Ways of Transportation</strong></h2>
Da Nang features a developed infrastructure that offers various transportation options. If you're planning to travel abroad, the international airport sits straight in the city and you can score direct flight lines around Asia for great prices. Once you're in the city, the motorbike is the king. I've bought a used Honda Wave for 7 million VND ($300) and drove it for more than a year.

Don't forget to check every detail on your bike while buying. We've written a detailed guide for <a href="https://vietnamchronicles.com/buy-motorbike-in-vietnam">buying a bike in Vietnam</a>, so check it out. If you're looking to buy a motorbike or bicycle or simply anything second-hand, head over to <a href="https://www.chotot.com/">ChoTot</a>, a Vietnamese online marketplace. <img class="size-large wp-image-5495 aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.transport-danang.jpg" alt="Traffic in Da Nang" width="1024" height="611" />
<div class="image_description">Traffic can't be compared to Saigon or Hanoi, but there are some congestions during rush hours. Avoid these hours if possible.</div>
Traffic is chaotic at times, especially during the rush hours (7 - 9 am and 4 - 6 pm), but you can't compare it to traffic in Saigon or Hanoi. There are also many rental places offering monthly rentals for around 1 million VND. Please note that it's necessary to have an international driving license or a local one (easy process if you have a car driving license in your home country).

Also, if you drive a bike with an <strong>engine smaller than 50cc you don't need a license</strong> (see Honda Cub 50). Police started to enforce it lately, so be sure you're driving legally not only because of the police but in case of an accident your insurance won't cover you. You can read our detailed guide on getting a <a href="https://vietnamchronicles.com/vietnamese-driving-license">lifetime Vietnamese driving license</a>. The liter of gas costs around 20,000 VND and scooters usually pass around 30 km on one liter.

I love to drive around, so I spend around 100,000 - 200,000 VND per week on gasoline. Don't forget to include the cost of bike maintenance here which is usually changing the oil (around 100,000 VND every 1,000 km).

Probably the best and most convenient way of transportation is Grab. You can get from the main bus station to the beach for 60,000 VND. Shorter rides will cost you not more than 20,000 VND. If you don't have the proper documents for driving the bike, go with Grab or bicycle.

You can find a used bicycle for 600,000 VND and it will serve you just well (not for long distances).

Also, don't forget to check other <a href="https://vietnamchronicles.com/mobile-apps-vietnam">useful mobile apps</a> that will help you during your time in Vietnam. <img class="wp-image-5496 size-full aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5dc3c20d6e03e.jpg" alt="Driving a motorbike around Da Nang" width="996" height="729" />
<div class="image_description">There are many beautiful roads around Da Nang. I really love to drive to the top of Hai Van pass where you have stunning views over Da Nang City.</div>
There are also a few taxi companies and public buses, but I've never used any of these. <a href="https://www.danangbus.vn/roadmap.html">Here</a> you can find a detailed bus route map with stations and prices. Also, we've written a detailed <a href="https://vietnamchronicles.com/public-transportation-in-vietnam">public transportation guide</a>, so it might be a good read.
<h2><strong>Co-Working Spaces &amp; Cafes</strong></h2>
If you work remotely, there is a pretty diverse selection of work-friendly cafes around Da Nang. I've been already writing about <a href="https://vietnamchronicles.com/working-cafes-in-da-nang">working cafes in Da Nang</a>, so be sure to check out my favorite cafes where you can get some creative and uninterrupted work done. I'm not a huge fan of coworking spaces, but there are a few popular places around the city, mainly in the city center (riverside).

The prices vary from place to place, but an average daily pass is around 150,000 VND which includes coffee/tea and water. <strong> </strong> Working cafes usually feature a stable and fast internet, ergonomic tables and chairs, loads of power sockets as well as a huge selection of drinks. I'm a coffee lover and so getting the espresso, or Vietnamese iced coffee (Cà phê sữa đá Sài Gòn) is my choice.

The prices vary from 20,000 - 35,000 VND. For smoothies or milk teas, you can expect to pay a bit more, about 40,000 - 60,000 VND. In some cafes, you can even order healthy food such as snacks or fresh fruits and vegetables.

Expect to pay for a plate of fruits with cereals or omelet around 80,000 VND. <img class="size-large wp-image-5490 aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.home-office-danang.jpg" alt="Home office in Da Nang" width="1024" height="768" />
<div class="image_description">I usually work from home nowadays. It's very convenient and I always make sure to have enough coffee around me. There are countless cafe's around making delicious and strong Vietnamese coffee for up to 20,000 VND.</div>
Anyway, most of my time I'm working at my apartment since I have a table and loads of street food vendors a few steps from my doorstep. The internet isn't the best, but mobile data serves as a great alternative. More on data packages later.
<h2><strong>Visa Options</strong></h2>
It's still relatively hassle-free to <a href="https://vietnamchronicles.com/vietnam-tourist-visa">get a tourist visa in Vietnam</a>, but is it the most convenient thing? I wouldn't say so. American citizens have the option to get a 1-year tourist visa, but still, they have to leave the country every three months. For other people who're on a tourist visa, you must leave the country every three months to do an infamous visa run.

It's a pretty simple, but time and nerve-consuming process. There are a few visa run agents in the city that provide a full service. I really can't recommend <a href="https://www.facebook.com/visatoliveinvietnam/">Lynn Visa</a> more (I don't earn any commission, just genuinely love her passion and work). I've already written about doing a <a href="https://vietnamchronicles.com/visa-run-vietnam">visa run from Vietnam</a> in detail, so don't forget to read it.

There are also business visas available, but I've heard some bad stories and I wouldn't recommend getting a business visa from the agency. If you're working as an <a href="https://vietnamchronicles.com/teach-english-vietnam">English teacher</a> or in any other industry, you'll most likely get a work permit (harder these days) and temporary resident card which enables you to stay in Vietnam for 2 years.

Getting married to a Vietnamese, investing, or starting a business can land you a temporary resident card, but still, visa policies are very dynamic and changing all the time, so maybe the best option at the moment is a tourist visa.
<h2><strong>Travel Insurance</strong></h2>
For a long time, I haven't had any travel insurance and that was probably the most stupid thing you can do. I've been a few times in a hospital (once doing CT and many checkings) and you don't want to look at hospital bills without the insurance. Get insurance! Currently, I'm using my Croatian travel insurance that covers my health, transportation changes, and some technology for roughly $30/month.

There are many travel insurance companies available, but I've seen people recommending World Nomads. I've never used it so I can't tell much about it. There are a few international hospitals in Da Nang with English speaking staff and modern medical equipment.

I've been to Hoan My hospital a few times and every time they did an extremely professional job.
<h2><strong>4G Internet</strong></h2>
You can pick among a few competitive carriers in Vietnam and Vinaphone supposed to be the best one. I'm using MobiFone and their (<em>C90N</em>) data plan with 120GB/month for 90,000 VND. Speeds are pretty good (not for uploading huge files or streaming) and the connection is stable which is everything I'm looking for. The phone number with the data plan costs about 250,000 VND at the airport and 200,000 VND in official stores.

Be sure to get your SIM card in the official store where they require your personal information since buying the SIM in local stores can lead to various problems. Did you know that Vietnam enjoys one of the world's lowest mobile data costs? According to <a href="https://www.cable.co.uk/mobiles/worldwide-data-pricing/">Cable.co.uk's research</a>, the average cost for 1GB of mobile data is just $0.06. For instance, I've bought a SIM in a local store without leaving any personal information and currently, I can call people, but no one can reach me out.

The carrier explained to me it happens if you don't update your personal information regularly. Also, the coverage of MobiFone is pretty good. I was driving on the bus from Da Nang to Saigon and during the whole trip, I didn't experience any major network problems.
<h2><strong>Nightlife in Da Nang</strong></h2>
<img class="size-full wp-image-5493 aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.locals-on-the-beach.jpg" alt="Vietnamese at the beach" width="991" height="741" />
<div class="image_description">Locals slowly start to gather and prepare their snacks and beers after sunset on the beach.</div>
Da Nang is a very relaxed city featuring a different type of nightlife than in places like Phnom Penh or Bangkok. There is a <em>'pub street'</em> with dozens of pubs playing loud music on the banks of Han River. It's a pretty cool spot to drink with friends, play some pool and enjoy western music. Locals love to have Nhau which translates to <a href="https://e.vnexpress.net/news/travel-life/eating-and-drinking-for-no-particular-purpose-3491077.html">drinking and eating without any certain reason</a>. There are countless of Nhau restaurants around An Thuong and beachside area where you can enjoy delicious Vietnamese food with a glass of beer always full.

I really enjoy walking around My Khe beach during the night that completely changes its vibe. <img class="size-large wp-image-5487 aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.family-party.jpg" alt="Family party in Da Nang" width="1024" height="541" />
<div class="image_description">Getting invited by the local family party was priceless. We were singing Croatian songs while they were singing Vietnamese songs. It was an amazing and drunk time! :)</div>
If you're looking for a relaxed atmosphere and live music, I can't recommend An Thuong area more. There are a few places with cheap beers, a vibrant bunch of people, live music, and thematic events. I suggest checking Crazy Cat's or Heaven bar (literally next to each other). A bottle of domestic beer costs around 20,000 VND in the bars around Da Nang. Are you looking for a rooftop bar? I recommend Alacarte or Novotel for stunning views, swimming pools, nice music, and a good selection of drinks.

The beer in Alacarte costs 80,000 VND, but they have a happy hour where you get two beers for the price of one (3 - 6 pm).
<h2><strong>Weather </strong></h2>
Da Nang officially has two seasons - dry and wet season. The dry season starts from February and ends around September while the wet season takes place from October all the way to January.

You can check a detailed post about the <a href="https://vietnamchronicles.com/best-time-to-visit-da-nang">best time to visit Da Nang</a> to get a better understanding of the weather and seasons in Da Nang. <img class="size-full wp-image-5489 aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.high-season-danang.jpg" alt="high season in Da Nang" width="986" height="735" />
<div class="image_description">My Khe beach is completely packed during the peak season. I recommend going to the northern beach near Son Tra to avoid crowds.</div>
Usually, tourists start to flock in from April till the end of August. I would say that April and May are the best months for enjoying the beach. From September you can expect changes in weather with more frequent showers. October and November are the months with the most rainfall and it's usual to experience a few storms and flooding during that period. Also, the temperature lowers down to 15°C.

Also, it's important to mention that some landlords tend to raise the accommodation prices during the dry season, so be sure to communicate everything in front and put everything in the contract.

		<Content><![CDATA[Hanoi is an immensely vibrant and busy city that features a unique local atmosphere, colorful buildings, delicious and diverse food which are some of the things that make it an ideal starting point for your Vietnam trip! The bustling capital was our first introduction to the Vietnamese and Southeast Asian cultures in general.

Many travelers decide to start their trip in Hanoi and slowly explore the country all the way to Saigon.

If you're short on time, but still looking to explore the hidden corners of Hanoi that'll introduce you to Vietnamese culture and traditions as well as rough history, then our 2 days in Hanoi itinerary is definitely for you.
<h2><strong>2 Days in Hanoi Itinerary - Explore a Vibrant Vietnamese Culture</strong></h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5633" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.hanoi-people.jpg" alt="Explore Vietnamese culture" width="780" height="580" /> Hanoi, the authentic and traditional capital of Vietnam, is one of the most visited places in Vietnam, and for a good reason! Sometimes, it feels like a massive village, as lots of former traditional villages converged to form a larger whole.

Alongside the local influence, there is a heavy French colonial vibe in the architecture and some of the cuisine.

For all you people who are visiting Hanoi either to kick off your road trip, experience the diverse street food options, or just opting to embrace the authentic atmosphere; it is very challenging to create an itinerary for just 2 days in Hanoi.

Hanoi is a huge city, with a <strong>population count of almost 8 million people and an area of 319.56 square kilometers</strong>! So, this itinerary is a combination of our personal experience in Hanoi and some places that we missed, but you definitely shouldn’t!

Also, if you want a tailored Hanoi itinerary, we can help you create the one that suits your budget and preferences!

<script async defer src="https://widget.getyourguide.com/v2/widget.js"></script>
<h2><strong>Day 1 - Strolling Around the Old Quarter</strong></h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-5639" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.cong-caphe.jpg" alt="Walking around the Old Quarter" width="1024" height="576" /> We hope that you are an early riser, as you are just spending 2 days in Hanoi, so why not maximize these two days? For breakfast, we suggest visiting the Old Quarter first. It is just beside all the major attractions that we will include in this itinerary. Don’t be intimidated by the chaotic traffic flowing through the Quarter since you will get used to it very quickly.

As you wander around in the morning, you will find numerous local restaurants around. You can spot a local restaurant by the tiny plastic stools and tables. They are also filled with locals who're kickstarting their day with a bowl of tasty Phở soup.

A bowl of Phở will cost you anywhere <strong>between 20,000 to 40,000 VND ($0,87 to $1,73)</strong>. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-5635" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.vietnamese-coffee.jpg" alt="Enjoy a tasty Vietnamese coffee" width="1024" height="575" /> After you finish your breakfast, we suggest a supercharging with a glass of cà phê sữa đá (<a href="https://vietnamchronicles.com/vietnamese-drip-coffee-guide">Vietnamese iced coffee</a>). The sweet caffeine bomb will set you from <strong>10,000 to 30,000 VND ($0,43 – $1,23)</strong>. If you like your coffee unique, why not try the popular Cà phê trứng (Egg coffee)? It will probably cost you some 10,000 to 20,000 VND more than the usual iced coffee, but it is well worth it! Arguably the best place for this traditional beverage is <a href="http://cafegiang.vn/">Cafe Giang</a>, so don't forget to check it out.

Just a few minutes away from the Old Quarter is Hoan Kiem Lake. It is a dash of relaxation in the otherwise hectic Hanoi center.

The lake is like a tranquil oasis just in the middle of the city that serves as a socializing spot for friendly locals who'll often invite you for a talk or dance. In the middle of the lake, you can see the magnificent, crumbling Turtle Tower from the <a href="http://en.hanoi.vietnamplus.vn/Home/The-legend-of-Hoan-Kiem-Lake/20099/220.vnplus">legend of the Hoan Kiem Lake</a>. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5634" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.hoan-kiem-lake.jpg" alt="Hoan Kiem Lake" width="781" height="585" /> After a dose of relaxation at the Hoan Kiem Lake, we suggest that you visit Ngoc Son Temple. The temple is located on the lake, and you can easily distinguish it by the bright red bridge called Huc Bridge.

It is a tranquil place that opens from 8 AM to 6 PM, and the <strong>entrance fee is 30,000 VND ($1,30)</strong>. Just a few minutes away from the Hoan Kiem Lake is the St. Joseph Cathedral serves as a fantastic showcase of Gothic architecture.

The exterior of the cathedral showcases the French architectural influence so prevalent in this side of the city. There is no entrance fee for the cathedral, so you are free to enter and enjoy the magnificent interior.

It features huge arch pillars and colorful Christian motifs. Make sure to wear long sleeves inside the cathedral. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5636" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.hanoi-cathedral.jpg" alt="St. Joseph Catherdral in Hanoi" width="783" height="583" /> You are probably craving for a snack now! Luckily, there are numerous <span lang="vi" title="Vietnamese language text">bánh mì</span> stalls in this neighborhood. It is a French baguette sandwich usually filled with freshly picked vegetables herbs and meat or eggs.

The average price on the street is <strong>from 15,000 VND to 30,000 VND ($0,65 to $1,08)</strong>. For a dose of education on the recent history of Vietnam, we suggest visiting the Hoa Lo Prison. It is just a 10-minute walk from St. Joseph Cathedral. Also known as the <em>Hanoi Hilton</em>, most of the prison has been destroyed for skyscraper construction.

The remains of the structure now serve as a museum. It was built by the French during the colonial period and mainly used as a prison for Vietnamese revolutionaries or anyone connected to them. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5637" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.prison-2.jpg" alt="Hoa Lo Prison" width="772" height="577" /> During the war in Vietnam, this place was also used to imprison the American POWs, hence the Hilton name. Prepare for some unsettling imagery as this museum details the hardships of Vietnamese people during the French colonial period.

We don't want to spoil you any more details, but you will leave with some exciting insights on how different was the treatment of prisoners during the two administrative periods. Hoa Lo prison is open from 8 AM to 5 PM, and the <strong>entrance fee is 30,000 VND ($1,30)</strong>. By now, you will want to tone down a bit on the sightseeing and enjoy the early evening hours.

You should head back to the Old Quarter, which is now starting to buzz with life. Locals are gathering for dinner, and are slowly starting with their beer binge!

There are numerous street food options to find around here, from rice noodles with meatballs (bun cha) to rice flour pancakes (bánh cuốn).

To get some ideas on what to eat, don't forget to check out our <a href="https://vietnamchronicles.com/vietnamese-street-food">Vietnamese street food guide</a>! <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5638" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.bia-hoi.jpg" alt="Bia Hoi in Hanoi" width="843" height="556" /> Probably the best way to end your first day in Hanoi is to indulge in the local drinking culture. By that, we mean - the beer. Beer in Vietnam is incredibly cheap, with prices<strong> starting from 5,000 VND (0,22 cents) for a 0,3 liter can of beer</strong>. There are numerous local bars around the Old Quarter which will be filled with locals who will enjoy sharing a drink with you.

Hanoi is also famous for one of the cheapest beers in the world - <a href="https://vietnamchronicles.com/bia-hoi-vietnam">Bia Hoi</a>. It is dirt-cheap, and you can get hammered for a few dollars.

<strong>Day 1 Summary:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Start the day with a bowl of Phở and a glass of coffee in the Old Quarter</li>
 	<li>Take a stroll and relax at Hoan Kiem Lake</li>
 	<li>Visit the tranquil Ngoc Son Temple</li>
 	<li>Marvel at the magnificent Gothic architecture of the St. Joseph Cathedral</li>
 	<li>Grab a <span lang="vi" title="Vietnamese language text">bánh mì</span> to regain your energy</li>
 	<li>Get some education at the Hoa Lo Prison</li>
 	<li>Enjoy the evening with some tasty street food and ice-cold beer</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Day 2 - Further Sightseeing of Hanoi</strong></h2>
We hope that you didn't wake up hungover from the last night, as the final part of our 2 days in Hanoi itinerary is taking place today! <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5641" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.street-food-hanoi.jpg" alt="Walking around Hanoi streets" width="782" height="583" /> To get back in motion, we suggest that you start your morning with a visit to the Dong Xuan Market. It is the busiest traditional market that you can find in the heart of Hanoi's Old Quarter. The opening time of the market is at 8 AM, and it closes at 6 PM. It is a very crowded market and is a great entry point to experience the chaotic market experience of Hanoi.

To get some breakfast, get to the northern side of the market where you can snatch some cheap breakfast, freshly squeezed juice, and buzz up with coffee. There is also a lot more to see here, from souvenir shops to clothing shops.
<div class="single_post_info_box"><i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle fa-2x"></i> <strong> Note:</strong> Make sure to haggle in this market and any other Vietnamese market! The most effective strategy is to cut the asking prices by 70% and start the negotiation process from there. Make sure to learn a few Vietnamese phrases, as this will induce a bit of respect from the locals. Maybe that's what you need for a decent bargain!</div>
As the first day of the itinerary was filled with a healthy balance of sightseeing and indulging the culture, we will continue this flow onwards. Either take a 25-minute walk or take a Grab to the Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum. It is one of the most popular attractions in Hanoi, as it is a final resting place in Ho Chi Minh. Interestingly, he never wanted his body to be embalmed, but rather wished his ashes to be spread after his death. The authorities built this magnificent structure instead, to honor him.

It is one of the most guarded places in Hanoi, so you should definitely obey the rules. Also, the line for the inner sanctum can get ridiculously long. Nevertheless, getting inside the mausoleum and seeing the embalmed body of Ho Chi Minh is definitely one of the highlights of Hanoi sightseeing tour. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5642" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.ho-chi-minh-mausoleum.jpg" alt="Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum" width="840" height="556" /> After the mausoleum, make sure to visit the Ho Chi Minh Museum. The <strong>entrance fee is 40,000 VND ($1,73)</strong>. This museum is distinguishable by its white lotus symbol, which symbolizes the homeland of Ho Chi Minh. It is divided into several sections.

The first section details the personal life of Ho Chi Minh, and how he became an influential revolutionary he is known for today. Another section shows the details of the war, and how the Vietnamese people emerged victorious from it. The last section shows some important historical events that had a severe impact on Ho Chi Minh's ideals. It is an ideal place to learn about Ho Chi Minh and his contribution to Vietnamese history. <img class="wp-image-5644 size-full aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5e10ce3e155fc.jpg" alt="One Pillar Pagoda in Hanoi" width="709" height="469" />
<div class="image_description">By <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/deepgoswami/5739930561/in/photolist-9KdDo2-Nmb4z7-Q3o6Wz-PpharK-6ewLBJ-boNA48-boNANF-boNBuT-aCpkY-QPj5nq-6kqwm1-6mVLdw-6mVME5-6mREDF-6gWtmh-2VNA8z-agurt9-ZMQu-eN977e-8jKQXr-2VTrL5-agurnG-9DHZv5-8RRtGi-aojaVr-7W9TM3-9JRRNZ-9Kd2k4-NG5ZmR-9Kd3uz-8Kmdbx-PGCdiS-2WdDCE-4Jj8g8-4JjaJp-9Kd4gR-fRTdzh-8KpgAQ-4JonME-dNbZUV-PmJoX3-95ZFDE-fRTDsb-dNbZE4-dNhxE3-dNbYLa-dNhyEU-bwBEgQ-dt11N-7Wady7">Deep Goswami</a> - One Pillar Pagoda, Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 2.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 2.0)</div>
Before you leave this complex, you should definitely check out the One Pillar Pagoda, which is one of the unique architectural accomplishments in Asia. The entrance to the pagoda is free, and it is open from 8 AM to 11.30 AM during the morning, and from 2 PM to 4 PM during the afternoon. What makes this pagoda unique is that it is placed on a stone pillar, seemingly defying gravity.

The exterior of the pagoda is magnificent, with beautiful lotus images in combination with wooden pillars. And the interior is equally as impressive, with the statue of Guan Yin Buddha dominating it. The whole area around the pagoda is very relaxing, so we recommend embracing the zen vibes beside the pond and the bodhi tree. Now, it is probably that time of the day when you need to get a snack and fill up with some coffee!

Go back to the Old Quarter and find some new amazing street food place, as there is always something new on the corner! After you regain your energy, we suggest a short walk to the National Museum of History. The <strong>entrance fee is 30,000 VND ($1,30)</strong>. You can visit it during the morning hours from 8 AM to noon, and during the afternoon hours from 1.30 PM to 5 PM.

There is a lot of history to learn about here, from the French invasion in Vietnam in the 19th century to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reunification_Day">reunification of Vietnam in 1975.</a> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-5650" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.ho-chi-minh-statue.jpg" alt="The statue of Ho Chi Minh in the National Museum of History." width="1024" height="768" /> The museum details the formation of modern Vietnam and shows their struggle for independence. We think that it is essential to learn about the history of the country you are visiting, gaining more perspective and further respect its people. That's why we wholly recommend you to visit it. <img class="wp-image-5645 size-full aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5e10cf4cd042b.jpg" alt="Thang Long Water Puppet Show" width="709" height="470" />

To end your final day in a traditional fashion, why not watch an evening show at the Thang Long Water Puppet Theatre? The opening time of the theatre is at 3 PM, 4.10 PM, 5.20 PM, 6.30 PM, and 8 PM. A one-hour performance consists of short stories that detail the life in ancient Vietnam. The puppet performance is backed by traditional tunes performed by a Vietnamese orchestra.

This unique experience will cost you <strong>100,000 VND ($4,33)</strong>. We advise that you book it in advance because this is one of the most popular attractions in Hanoi.

<h2><strong>Getting To &amp; Around Hanoi</strong></h2>
Hanoi is the second-largest city in Vietnam and hosts more than 16 million tourists annually. It is only understandable that the tourism infrastructure is quite developed in Hanoi. Getting to Hanoi is quite convenient as there is the main national highway connection to the southern and northern provinces. You can get to Hanoi by international or domestic flight, bus, or train.
<h3><strong>Getting from the Noi Bai Airport to Hanoi Old Quarter</strong></h3>
<p id="CxTwfjc"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5646 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5e10cfffd42ed.jpg" alt="Thang Long Bridge, Hanoi" width="945" height="628" /></p>
If you are landing in Hanoi at the Noi Bai International Airport, the best option for you is to book a Grab ride to your accommodation. The airport is quite away from the city center - almost 30 kilometers away from the Old District!

<script async defer src="https://widget.getyourguide.com/v2/widget.js"></script>

There are numerous methods on how to reach Hanoi from the airport. You can either board the bus 7 that goes to the Kim Ma Station, or the bus 17 that goes to the Long Bien Station. The ticket will cost you 5,000 VND (around 22 cents), and the ride will take one hour. There is also a new bus 86. It has Wi-Fi and will take you to the city center or directly to your accommodation for the price of 32,000 VND to 64,000 VND ($1,38 to $2,75).

Be sure to check a <a href="http://www.vnu.edu.vn/ttsk/vietnamese/c1736/c1748/2009/07/n26392/hanoi_xebuyt_vnu_l1.jpg">detailed Hanoi bus map</a> for convenience. You can also book a Grab ride from the airport, although it may cost you more than the bus in some cases. Beware of fake Grab and taxi drivers who usually pull <a href="https://vietnamchronicles.com/scams-in-vietnam">various tourist scams</a>.
<h3><strong>Getting Around Hanoi</strong></h3>
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-5630 size-large" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.getting-around-hanoi.jpg" alt="Getting around Hanoi with the bus" width="1024" height="573" /> You can board the city buses that connect the two most populated areas in Hanoi - Kim Ma and Yen Nghia. They come in red, yellow, and white colors, and the rates range from 5,000 to 10,000 VND (22 cents to 43 cents). Another great option to get around Hanoi is to book a ride via the Grab smartphone app. You can book a car or even a motorbike taxi if you are feeling more adventurous.

The prices will vary on the availability of the drivers, number of passengers, and the trip distance. We advise you to avoid taxis as they are usually more expensive than Grab. They will often involve more hassle when it comes to negotiating a fair price. Of course, you can always rent a motorbike in Hanoi, if you wish to brave the traffic on your own! The rental prices will vary depending on the business you choose.

Whether your choice of transport in Hanoi may be, there are numerous options to choose from for every budget and type of traveler.

Make sure to read our <a href="https://vietnamchronicles.com/public-transportation-in-vietnam">guide on public transportation in Vietnam </a>to get a better outlook.
<h2><strong>Where to Stay in Hanoi - Accommodation Options &amp; Prices</strong></h2>
Hanoi hosts thousands of different accommodation options. From budget guesthouses and hostels to luxury hotels, there is something for every budget. From our perspective, we can give an outlook on two accommodation options we’ve stayed in Hanoi.

We’ve stayed in is the Hanoi Pleasant House. It is right in the heart of the Old Quarter and is an excellent budget option that costs us around 200,000 VND a night ($8,65). While not the best accommodation when it comes to the facilities themselves, our host was extremely helpful who even organized our ride to the airport. Also, the location couldn’t be better!

		<Content><![CDATA[Arriving in colorful and vibrant Vietnam's capital Hanoi and don't know what to do during the night? Hanoi is a never-sleeping capital with more than 8 million people constantly wandering around. It's very amazing how the city changes its vibe once the night falls down. Everything changes. We literally mean everything! The empty alleys become extraordinarily busy with people drinking on tiny chairs, old people get out for their share of physical activity, a mixture of various spices leads you to most amazing street restaurants...

Hanoi is the place to be at night. If you're lacking the ideas of things to do in Hanoi at night, here's your inspiration.

Keep reading and don't forget to share your experiences and ideas with others.
<h2><strong>#1- Explore Vietnamese Culture Through Delicious Food</strong></h2>
<div>
<p id="OCptYrC"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5668 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5e39cb9f627e0.jpg" alt="Try delicious Vietnamese street food. " width="1164" height="866" /></p>

</div>
<div>One thing we wanted to do in Vietnam was to eat all the food, all the time. After we returned to Hanoi from our Ha Long Bay cruise, exploring street food delicacies was high on our list. We decided to go with a local guide so we could try all the finest home-cooked and hard to find gems in the city. It was a brilliant way to get a feel of the city as we walked around tiny colorful alleys.</div>
<div></div>
<div>I can tell you finding food in Hanoi is not hard, but finding the best is much more comfortable with a local leading the way. If you're a foodie lover, just wandering around the city and trying the most delicious and diverse street food you can imagine...you'll be planning your return trip before the <span class="il">night</span> is over.</div>

<h2><strong>#2- Long Bien Market</strong></h2>
<div>
<p id="mgYiUSd"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5665 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5e39ca6ac97c5.jpg" alt="Things to do in Hanoi at night - Long Bien Market" width="893" height="674" /></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://wander-lush.org/guide-quang-ba-flower-market-long-bien-market/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://wander-lush.org/guide-quang-ba-flower-market-long-bien-market/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1575267674464000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFvb1kwyj2Gs3XY1dX9R6rCNerrPA">Long Bien Night Market</a> is the biggest produce market in Northern Vietnam. Trucks from as far away as southern China start pulling into the city in the wee hours, unloading fruit and fresh veggies for restaurants and market vendors to re-sell the following day. The market kicks off at around 1 am and wraps up at 5 am, making it a fun thing to do in Hanoi at night.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Get up early or stay up late, the choice is yours. Plan to arrive at the market at about 3 am when activity reaches its peak. It takes about 2 hours to explore the market thoroughly, after which you can walk along Long Bien Bridge and catch the breathtaking sunrise popping over skyscrapers.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Long Bien is a wholesale market, so everything is displayed in excess – small mountains of pineapples, crates upon crates of mangoes and smelly durian. People rush back and forth through the market’s narrow alleys on a motorbike. As you meander along, watch your toes lest a rogue trolley hits you.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a good idea to pair Long Bien Night Market with Quang Ba Flower Market in Tay Ho, which is open from 2 am until 4 am daily.</p>
<strong>p.s. </strong>if you only have a day or two in Hanoi, don't forget to read our <a href="https://vietnamchronicles.com/2-days-in-hanoi">2 days in Hanoi itinerary</a> and plan an awesome trip.

<h2><strong>#3- Hoan Kiem Lake</strong></h2>
<p id="abrjhti"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5666 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5e39caa7370df.jpg" alt="Hoan Kiem Lake at Night" width="1279" height="845" /></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Keen to see how Hanoi winds down after a busy day at work? Head to the Hoan Kiem lake after the sun goes down. The lake, located a stone’s throw from the bustling Hanoi Old Quarter, is a vibrant place where you’ll see local Hanoians taking time out for a quick run, practicing their tai chi or even breaking out the boombox as a group of ladies tries their hand at lakeside aerobics and dance! It’s a must on any <a href="https://thetravelscribes.com/3-week-vietnam-itinerary/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://thetravelscribes.com/3-week-vietnam-itinerary/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1575267674456000&amp;usg=AFQjCNF19XoObR6t-3O7g0mnqRjbLETWwA">Vietnam itinerary</a>.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">If you take a stroll around the lake, you’ll encounter all of this and more: young couples on a date, avid photographers taking pictures and partygoers getting ready for a night out, since many of the city’s best bars flank the lake itself. The area is perfect if you’re a fan of bright lights too: the bridge and surrounding buildings light up with multicolored hues, making for some incredible reflections on the water’s glassy surface.</p>

<h2><strong>#4- Quang Ba Flower Market</strong></h2>
<div>
<p id="xauyldI"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5669 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5e39cbf7e106f.jpg" alt="Quang Ba Flower Market" width="946" height="631" /></p>

</div>
<div>While the rest of the city is asleep, the Quang Ba flower market is bustling and crowded. Located on Nghi Tam in the Tay Ho district, this <span class="il">night</span> market is the largest, providing fresh flowers to the entire city. It opens around midnight and continues well after the sun rises with flowers that have been shipped in from all over the country, that make for some of the best <a href="https://www.araioflight.com/shopping-vietnam-souvenirs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.araioflight.com/shopping-vietnam-souvenirs/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1575267674436000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGMrWxEilsLvEIPXGqrGzsRXlfTqw">Vietnam souvenirs</a>. Even if you don't want any flowers, there is always some good food and beers served all <span class="il">night</span>.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The Quang Ba Flower Market remains <span class="il">Hanoi</span>’s most unusual attraction, allowing you to see the city in a new light, and one of the best things to do at <span class="il">night</span>.</div>

<h2><strong>#5- Enjoy the Cheapest Beer in the World, Bia Hoi</strong></h2>
<div>
<p id="HPybkSe"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5667 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5e39cade4445d.jpg" alt="Bia Hoi is one of the funniest things to do in Hanoi at night" width="882" height="631" /></p>

</div>
<div>Vietnam is famous for its ridiculously <a href="https://vietnamchronicles.com/bia-hoi-vietnam">cheap beer called bia hoi</a>, known for being the cheapest beer in Southeast Asia (possibly the world), costing around 5,000 VND/glass ($0.24). And in <span class="il">Hanoi,</span> there is a famous Bia Hoi street and institute for <span class="il">night</span> time beering along Ta Hien Street, which is more or less a street lined with tiny plastic chairs, super cheap beer, and intriguing youth culture.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Spanning out are then shops and alleys selling similar cheap bia hoi beer. The beer isn’t great, to be honest, but it is also easy to upgrade to some $0.70 premium beers, and there is also cheap <a href="https://www.live-less-ordinary.com/top-10-vietnamese-food-eating-in-vietnam/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.live-less-ordinary.com/top-10-vietnamese-food-eating-in-vietnam/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1575267674299000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFE-g0M-3g0i8H3K1UYBUd0oooM4g">Vietnamese food</a> on the menu, to make the most of the unique nightlife and a cheap <span class="il">night</span> out.</div>
<em>Special thanks to Allan from Live-Less-Ordinary for this amazing entry. Don't forget to follow their journey on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/livelessordinary/">Instagram</a>.</em>
<h2><strong>#6- Old Quarter</strong></h2>
<div>
<p id="sNEasVB"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5670 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5e39cc1ece59f.jpg" alt="Wander around Old Quarter" width="948" height="630" /></p>

</div>
<div><span class="il">Hanoi</span>'s Old Quarter is a mecca for foodies, shoppers, photographers, and culture seekers. When the sun sets the area buzzes with buskers, people taking gentle strolls, and vendors selling all kinds of interesting knick-knacks. Start your <span class="il">night</span> by taking in the sights and sounds of the 36 Old Streets near the East Gate remains, then work your way back towards Hoan Kiem Lake. Along the way, you'll find many restaurants and street food vendors dishing up classics such as pho, banh mi, and other great local favorites.</div>
<div></div>
<div>However, for a truly unique experience, skip the fancy restaurants and dive right into <a href="https://vietnamchronicles.com/vietnamese-street-food">authentic Vietnamese street food</a> at one of the sidewalk vendors. After you've filled your tummy, head out to one of the many bars and coffee shops where you can enjoy an ice-cold bia hoi or a smooth ca phe trung  (egg coffee). Those looking to experience the craziness of the Old Quarter's nightlife shouldn't miss stopping by Bia Hoi Junction, either.</div>
<div>

The Old Quarter is a must for anyone wanting to explore one of the <a href="https://hoponworld.com/the-best-places-to-visit-in-vietnam/">best places in Vietnam</a>.

<h2><strong>#7- Cafe Pho Co</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe style="border: none; overflow: hidden;" src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fthelostpassport%2Fvideos%2F1217641888356266%2F&amp;show_text=0&amp;width=560" width="560" height="322" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
The Vietnamese love a good coffee. You only have to walk through <a href="https://www.thelostpassport.com/hanoi-travel-guide/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hanoi</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for a few minutes to find the locals sitting around roadside tables waiting for a <a href="https://vietnamchronicles.com/vietnamese-drip-coffee-guide">strong cup of Vietnamese coffee</a> to brew. However, one of the best places isn’t quite as straightforward to find. Café Pho Co is a secret rooftop coffee shop in Hanoi’s Old Quarter overlooking Hoan Kiem Lake. The entrance to this peaceful café is located behind a silk store down a dark alley. Open until 11 pm, it is also one of the most relaxing places to take a step back from Hanoi’s street-level madness and watch the lights come on as night takes over. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>Special thanks to Josh Shephard from The Lost Passport for this amazing entry. Follow his inspiring journey on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/thelostpassport">Facebook.</a></em> </span>

As you can see, Hanoi is one of these amazing places that never sleeps. Prepare yourself for an amazing journey. Drink a strong cup of Vietnamese coffee, eat a bowl of Pho and you're ready for memorable (or not so!) all-nighter... And if you still remember what happened, don't forget to share your experiences below! Mot Hai Ba YOOO! :) :)

]]></Excerpt>

		<Content><![CDATA[So you've been thinking of moving to Vietnam, but still weighing the good and the bad. Two years ago, I thought I'll stay in Vietnam just for three months to complete my volunteering project in beautiful Nghe An province, but I ended up calling Vietnam my home. It was so unexpected and unplanned, but I can't be happier with that decision.

I am so fortunate to have a chance to live in different places around the country, including one of the poorest provinces, Nghe An and one of the fastest developing cities, Da Nang.

Continue reading if you'd like to know the pros and cons of living in Vietnam. Please keep in mind it's my subjective opinion so that it may differ from other people's experiences. Let's start!
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Cons of Living in Vietnam</strong></h2>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><strong>High Pollution Levels</strong></h2>
The majority of developing countries face the pollution problem, and Vietnam falls into the same bucket. Pollution is everywhere, and it's unfortunate to see how short term development is favored over long-term consequences. I can understand that since the country still faces high poverty rates, and fast-paced growth provides jobs and drives the economy.

Anyway, the consequences are real. Lately, Hanoi hits the highest on the <a href="https://vietnaminsider.vn/why-hanoi-and-hcm-city-ranked-among-top-three-worlds-most-polluted-cities/">list of the most polluted cities in the world</a>. Air quality is pretty bad in the cities, and on some days, you can notice the layer of smog in the distance.

The air is much better in the countryside, but the life quality struggles, especially for expats as lacking infrastructure is real. Another shocking thing I've experienced is a culture of littering. As I was living near the beach in Nghe An, I loved to spend time on the beach. Unfortunately, beaches and surrounding area serve as a garbage dump for locals. You can find all kinds of plastics, styrofoam, nylon, fishermen, nets, etc.

The majority of that trash ends up in the sea, and gradually over time, it affects a marine life that's the primary source of income and life in the region. I guess it's a lack of education on the matter, and I'm not blaming people, but I believe we, especially expats, should work hard to educate locals and save the environment.

I've experienced small kids aggressively throwing covers of candy or plastic glasses on the road during the motorbike drive. The parents seem not to care at all, which again touches the point of lack of education. Currently, especially in bigger cities, the younger students and professionals started to show an initiative about saving the environment so you can join many beach clean-ups, educational events, and fundraisers, which is quite impressive!

The video below shows one of the best views in Vietnam - the top of Hai Van Pass. You can see yourself how much trash and plastics is around...

<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ETCkhz9jFYw" width="764" height="430" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>
<h2><strong>Chaotic Traffic (You'll Soon Get Used to It!)</strong></h2>
Alright, probably you've already heard about Vietnamese traffic, so I will be short here. I was extremely shocked to see traffic after I've landed in Hanoi. Since the tax on car imports is enormous, people's primary vehicle is a motorbike. Did you know that officially there are around <a href="https://e.vnexpress.net/news/business/vietnam-remains-kingdom-of-motorbikes-as-sales-rev-up-in-2016-3527969.html">45 million registered motorbikes</a> operating daily? Imagine that! It's close to one bike for every two people, which is just mindblowing.

Now imagine that amount of motorcycles on the roads...crazy, huh? Once you start driving and get comfortable, you'll notice that there is a flow in traffic that everyone follows. The majority of people are aware of each other and traffic, most of the time, goes smoothly.

Don't be surprised about the constant honking since it serves as an indicator to show others that you are in the traffic.

Be extra careful of trucks and buses since, in Vietnam, there is an unwritten rule - the priority goes to the bigger vehicle.

<h2><strong>Lack of Food Hygiene</strong></h2>
Vietnamese street food scene is booming, and it's one of my favorite parts of the country, but it comes with downsides. The most significant disadvantage is food hygiene or lack of the same since locals prepare food on the street.

The air quality, insects, dust, non-drinkable tap water, wild rats are just a few aspects that lower food hygiene. I've been talking with many expats, and some of them are very concerned about food hygiene.

Many people traveling and living here got stomach problems related to food. Luckily for me, I've never experienced any problem with food in Vietnam (knocking on wood), and I enjoy street food every day.
<h2><strong>Rapid Development and Construction Everywhere</strong></h2>
<img class="wp-image-5734 size-full aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5e692e221b0e9.jpg" alt="Construction is everywhere in Vietnam." width="1120" height="756" />
<div class="image_description">Construction is everywhere, especially in low developed regions such as Nghe An province. When it comes to the countryside, it's sad to see mid-aged women working on construction sites.</div>
Rapid development isn't necessarily a bad thing as it creates job opportunities for locals and improves their quality of life. Anyway, in some places, the construction and development pace is out of control, which has many adverse effects.

For example, in Da Nang (An Thuong area), it's so hard to find a single street without construction work going on. It's very shocking to see that the majority of construction workers are middle-aged women who work from morning till dark (sometimes during the night, too).

I must mention that I haven't noticed women working on construction sites in the big cities, but in the countryside. If you know more about the reasons behind it, please let us know. When it comes to more significant projects, like building large hotels or infrastructure, the majority of workers aren't Vietnamese people, but 'imported' Chinese workers.

How much does rapid development improve the life quality of the regular Vietnamese family? I have to mention that apartment hunting is profoundly affected by rapid construction in the cities. While I was living in Da Nang, An Thuong area was going through significant infrastructure upgrades, which translates to dust, unbearable noise, and bad traffic.

It's tough to live next to a large construction site, so when you're hunting for your next apartment, be sure to rent the place for a few nights before signing a contract.

Thank me later for that. :)
<h2><strong>Occasional Power &amp; Internet Outage</strong></h2>
<img class="wp-image-5731 size-full aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5e692cc19db84.jpg" alt="Electrical wires in Hanoi" width="1495" height="840" />
<div class="image_description">Just look at the wires, and you'll understand why power blackouts are a regular thing.</div>
As in the majority of developing countries, electrical infrastructure doesn't follow the pace of development, so it's not a strange thing to experience a few power or internet outages per day. When I was living in the countryside, we've experienced a power outage almost every day, and it was very frustrating. Anyway, you have to embrace it if you decide to live or travel in the countryside.

That's one of the main reasons I've mentioned that the countryside might not be the best option for expats, especially if you need a stable internet connection and electricity.

When it comes to cities, the situation is a way better, but still, there are some occasional power blackouts. In Da Nang, for example, when the construction site is around, you can count for a few outages per day.

Also, sometimes the trucks break the electrical wires, and it causes the blackout in the whole block.

The good thing is that the majority of apartments/cafes have power generators in case of a prolonged power outage.
<h2><strong>Language Barrier is REAL</strong></h2>
The language barrier is REAL, and sometimes, it gets tough to establish a basic conversation with locals. When I've first arrived in Vietnam, I've been living in a rural province of Nghe An, where I could count on the fingers of one hand people who could speak English. At first, it's bizarre, but after a while, you understand that people living in rural areas simply don't have time and money to learn English.

Plus, on top of that, you are the foreigner in their country, and you should adjust. These people are hard workers leaving their sweat in the rice fields to put the food on the table.

The younger population, teenagers, and primary school kids are learning conversational English at a swift pace. I've met a few teenagers, and we could speak and understand each other with the support of Google Translate.

I was teaching school kids English as a part of a volunteering project in Nghe An, and you can read my volunteering experience <a href="https://vietnamchronicles.com/starlight-english-center-vietnam">here</a>.

Not to forget, Google Translate in Vietnam helps a lot, even in the remotest areas. The translation isn't perfect all the time, but people seem to understand the context, which makes communication way more manageable. <img class="wp-image-5746 size-full aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5e6b84182e620.jpg" alt="Language exchange in Da Nang, Vietnam." width="1168" height="872" />
<div class="image_description">I was helping young Vietnamese people to improve their English, and in exchange, I've met beautiful people that I can call friends these days. Also, you can learn a lot about the culture, traditions, challenges these people face, and learn the basics of Vietnamese. Such a win-win situation.</div>
When it comes to big cities, the level of English is a way higher, which means the majority of younger people know the basics, but only a small percentage can hold a conversation. The demand for English is enormous, and the best example shows the rapid growth of English so-called schools or centers on each step.

If you're planning to relocate to Vietnam, start learning Vietnamese from day 1. Not only it will help you in connecting with locals, but you'll be able to get better prices, learn more about Vietnamese culture, and it's fun! I'm currently learning Vietnamese in exchange for sharing my language. The best way to acquire Vietnamese is to meet local people who're looking to improve their English. Such a win-win situation.
<h2><strong>Loud Karaoke Bars</strong></h2>
Alright, this doesn't necessarily need to be a downside, but these fancy karaoke bars can turn in your biggest nightmare overnight. Singing karaoke with friends and family is one of the staple cultural activities of Vietnamese people, so expect a lot of karaoke bars. Why are these bars a downside? Well, if you're living in bigger cities such as Da Nang, in some areas, there are multiple karaoke bars next to each other.

The isolation is close to non-existent, and people usually participate in this intense activity during the night, so you can guess it. It's very noisy and sometimes annoying to hear drunk people trying to sing.

When you're searching for the apartment, I recommend exploring the surrounding area and booking a few nights before signing a lease since you'll get a better understanding of the area.
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Pros of Living in Vietnam</strong></h2>
<h2><strong>Friendly Vietnamese People</strong></h2>
<img class="wp-image-5741 size-full aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5e693419f2b64.jpg" alt="Friendly Vietnamese people." width="1506" height="841" />
<div class="image_description">Randomly got invited by the local family that we've met at the very moment. We were sharing our music, they were sharing their music, we drank loads of beer and ate delicious food. Vietnamese people are awesome!</div>
So, the story goes like this. I've been driving my old and broken backpacker's Win and in the middle of nowhere, I ended up without fuel. I accepted the fact that I'm going to push the bike for a while on an extreme heat until I find a gas station. After 5 minutes, I'm about to give up and wait for the sun to goes down a bit, but here come the locals. They didn't ask anything, they've just put their leg on my bike and pushed me.

It was shocking, funny, and dangerous, but they reduced my struggle. Another story was when I was driving around the highlands and got caught in a massive rain. I've stopped near some house to get the raincoat and continue driving, but locals get out and insisted that I cover from the rain in their home. I could write a whole book with anecdotes of <a href="https://www.asabbatical.com/article/everything-you-should-know-about-vietnamese-people">friendly Vietnamese people</a>.

Some people will tell that Vietnamese people are generous because they expect something in return. I would strongly disagree regarding the general population, but for sure, there are some people, especially in touristic places, who're pretending to be friendly just to sell you something.

If you're traveling around tourist places, be sure to prepare yourself and learn about <a href="https://vietnamchronicles.com/scams-in-vietnam">common scams in Vietnam</a> before bragging that Vietnamese people just want your money. Anyway, Vietnamese people are amicable and kind. They are always ready to help, share a broad smile that makes up even the worst day, and can listen and understand. I'm a people's person and always trying to form a connection and empathy with people.

Please have in mind that it's my subjective experience. I've been traveling around Vietnam for the past two years and really can't remember any bad experience with people.
<h2><strong>A Heaven for Foodie Lovers</strong></h2>
<img class="wp-image-5739 size-full aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5e69329296b45.jpg" alt="Banh Mi street food." width="1144" height="862" />
<div class="image_description">My favorite Vietnamese street food is, by far a crispy Banh Mi with eggs, pork, and fresh vegetables. Also, I love to add loads of soy sauce and chill for extra flavor.</div>
Hands down to the best cuisine I've had a chance to try. Vietnamese food culture, or more specifically, street food culture makes everyone wondering about mouthwatering dishes came straight from the source. <a href="https://vietnamchronicles.com/vietnamese-street-food">Vietnamese food</a> is exceptionally fresh and diverse, which makes me believe you simply can't end up without the ideas of what to eat next.

I was living in Da Nang for a year, and I probably tried more than 50 authentic dishes from the region. Oh, did I mention that food differs from region to region? Some areas serve the same food, but people use different spices, herbs, or ways of preparation, which ends up like a completely different dish. If you ever have the chance to explore the whole country, you'll soon realize the specialties differ as you progress to the north or south.

For instance, the north is known for its authentic Pho, while the central region is known for its delicious bowl of Mi Quang. On top of having abundant choices when it comes to eating, the food is extremely affordable, and you can find it on each step. Many times it happened that I didn't know what I'd exactly love to eat, so I just drive the bike around until I've found a friendly local with a broad smile preparing food on the street.

What amazes me the most is how affordable the food is. If you're eating on the street, you can expect to pay anywhere from 10,000 - 70,000 for a hearty meal. Have in mind that noodle soups usually costs in the 30,000 VND range, while rice combinations can cost a bit more, depending on how much food you have on your plate.
<h2><strong>Vibrant Coffee Scene</strong></h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jTbiGpXss7I" width="764" height="430" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>

Whoever traveled around Vietnam knows about <a href="https://vietnamchronicles.com/vietnamese-coffee-culture">Vietnamese coffee</a>. It would be a sin no to try a sip of this hot rhapsody, and once you try, it's tough to get used to any other coffee. I'm a huge coffee addict who loves simplicity, so I usually go with standard coffee with milk and ice (caphe sua da). Vietnamese people tend to use a lot of Robusta beans since it's very cheap and tasty.

Some upscale cafes have different beans on the menu, such as Arabica beans from regions such as Da Lat, or even Ethiopia or Colombia. Anyway, a cup of Vietnamese coffee is robust and features a pleasant coffee aroma and sweetened taste of condensed milk. Wanna learn how to prepare an authentic Vietnamese coffee with milk? Check our detailed guide <a href="https://vietnamchronicles.com/vietnamese-drip-coffee-guide">here</a>.

Locals are religious about their coffee breaks, which usually takes place all-around day. There is no way that a Vietnamese person will reject an invitation for a talk with a coffee. Local coffee shops cater to locals who bet on the cards or play Chinese chess during their break. Also, quite popular are gaming cafes where youngsters stare at their phones and play popular multiplayer games.

I really love the coffee scene, not only for the coffee itself but also for the ambient that gives me a focus required for my freelance business. In some bigger cafe franchises such as High5, Highlands Coffee or House of Cha, you may find a perfect spot for working on your laptop. Also, locals tend to study and work there so it's just an ideal place to get some work done.

If you're in Da Nang and looking for a cozy cafe where you can work online, here's the list of all <a href="https://vietnamchronicles.com/working-cafes-in-da-nang">work-friendly places in Da Nang</a>. The coffee culture is just a part of colorful Vietnamese culture, and if you're a coffee addict like me, you'll get along.

Not to forget, coffee is exceptionally affordable, and menus offer abundant choices.
<h2><strong>Breathtaking Landscape </strong></h2>
<img class="wp-image-5740 size-full aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5e6933677ff51.jpg" alt="A view from Mua Cave." width="1210" height="861" />
<div class="image_description">Stunning views from the top of Mua Caves, Ninh Binh.</div>
People associate Vietnam with many things such as friendly people, mouthwatering food, beautiful women, strong coffee, but we can't miss a breathtaking landscape. Hands down, Vietnam is the land of diversity, and landscape definitely falls into that description. I was fortunate enough that upon my arrival, I had a chance to visit the stunning Halong Bay and Tam Coc area.

Whoever plans to visit Halong Bay, I can't recommend more <a href="https://vietnamchronicles.com/halong-bay-vietnam">climbing to Bai Tho mountain</a> and enjoying the view over the city and the bay. Once I sat on the motorbike (it took a while), I've experienced extreme freedom in going off the beaten path and honestly exploring the diversity of landscape in Vietnam. The north is known for its high peaks, terrace rice fields, narrow roads, and solely breathtaking views.

If you're about to travel north, don't forget to drive a stunning <a href="https://vietnamchronicles.com/ha-giang-loop">Ha Giang loop</a>. Once you start going south, you'll experience windy mountain passes offering stunning views over cities (Hai Van I'm talking about you!), as well as dense jungle roads near the Laos border.

Kontum and Pleiku area features the heart of Central Highlands, where the majority of ethnic groups live, so not only you're going to experience a stunning landscape, but also, you're going to see a different way of living. I'd say that the south is a bit more specific when it comes to beaches as the tiny islands surround the coast. Once you proceed further south, around Mui Ne area, you'll experience a sand desert out of nowhere.

Can Tho city is known as a Mekong Delta area where you can explore river streams and how life goes on there. Vietnam has it all, and it's a very diverse country landscape wise. In my opinion, by far, the best way to truly experience the landscape and everything else Vietnam offers is by <a href="https://vietnamchronicles.com/buy-motorbike-in-vietnam">getting a second-hand motorbike</a> and go on a lifetime adventure. Looking for a beautiful motorbike route from Hanoi to Saigon?

We've traveled from <a href="https://vietnamchronicles.com/hanoi-to-saigon">Hanoi to Saigon on the bikes in 30 days</a>, so don't forget to check it out.
<h2><strong>Lively Expat Community</strong></h2>
If you're looking to form meaningful connections with fellow travelers or expats, you're lucky as the bigger cities feature a vibrant expat community. Since I was living in Da Nang, I can speak for that city and its expat community.

What I'd like to mention is that at the beginning, I was mainly hanging around the foreigners in An Thuong area, but after a while, I've got a feeling that I was missing out from authentic Vietnamese culture.

That was the moment when I stopped hanging so much around expat area and start to interact mainly with Vietnamese people. Currently, I'm balancing things out, and it works wonders for me.

I've met so many people who shared the same experience. Getting to Vietnam to learn more about the country, its people and culture, ending up being surrounded by westerners all the time.

What are your thoughts on it? In Da Nang, you have a large and helpful expat group with hefty of valuable advice and recommendations. Also, if you're a digital nomad or would love to know more about the lifestyle, there is an active DN group with weekly meetups, which is fantastic for forming relationships and friendships.

I can't speak for other cities, but from the Facebook groups, I can tell Saigon and Hanoi feature a way bigger expat groups with more activities and events going on.

Don't worry, even if you don't speak Vietnamese, you'll find your pack of people in Vietnam. :)
<h2><strong>Affordable Costs of Living</strong></h2>
<img class="wp-image-5749 size-full aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5e6b881cdf565.jpg" alt="my regular vietnamese meal" width="1157" height="864" />
<div class="image_description">This is how my regular Vietnamese lunch looks like. It's a pretty healthy and filling meal. All you can see on the table costs around 30,000 VND, which is roughly $1.25.</div>
Expats enjoy a pretty affordable cost of living compared to western countries in Vietnam. You can live a pretty decent life, filled with activities, having your own motorbike and fully furnished apartment, eating out every meal without breaking the bank. I've been writing about my experience while <a href="https://vietnamchronicles.com/living-in-da-nang">living in Da Nang</a> before, so you can check a detailed living cost breakdown.

Please note that I'm not partying hard, but I spend my money on other things such as gas, a motorbike, and loads of coffee! :D

Living 2 minutes from the beautiful beach, having a full street of diverse street food, and tiny cafes is everything I need. I was spending about $600 per month and didn't miss anything. Please note that I was also saving the money while building my business, so this might be a meager cost.

For a pretty comfortable life having a modern apartment in expat area, going out almost every night, and not worrying about the money, you can easily spend $1,000 per month. Anyway, for the quality of the life you get for your money spent, you simply can't beat it.
<h2><strong>Latin Alphabet</strong></h2>
This one is huge, especially for someone who loves to explore. In Vietnam, the popular way to explore the country is by driving your motorbike. Everything, the traffic signs, menus, and navigation signs use the Latin alphabet. It makes it extremely easy to navigate around the country where you possibly don't understand more than 10 words.

While driving on the open roads, you don't need to use navigation. Once you're in the city and looking for a specific place, the navigation comes handy. When it comes to food, drinks, nightlife, and all other fun, you'll find everything easy to understand. Also, in tourist places, you can expect menus on English, which is a huge plus, but also a sign of tourist prices. :D

Anyway, navigating around the country and understanding what you're ordering is extremely easy, mainly because of the Latin alphabet.
<h2><strong>Pleasant Weather</strong></h2>
<img class="wp-image-5742 size-full aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5e6935d629534.jpg" alt="A nice weather and the beach in Hoi An, Central Vietnam." width="1160" height="707" />
<div class="image_description">One beautiful sunny day in Hoi An, An Bang beach.</div>
Since I'm coming from a country known for its cold winters and sweltering and dry summers, a climate in Vietnam was a pleasant surprise. At first, I was living in Nghe An, and the province is known for a super dry wind blowing from neighboring Laos during April - June. If you ask me to describe hell, then it would be staying in the place with a dry Lao wind pouring on you.

Da Nang was a pleasant surprise as the majority of the time, you'll experience sunny weather perfect for the beach. You can check my full article explaining different <a href="https://vietnamchronicles.com/best-time-to-visit-da-nang">seasons in Da Nang</a> and finding the best time to visit the city. Anyway, you can expect sunny and stable weather from March to October. From October to December, the temperature started to decrease while the weather became a bit unstable slowly.

A period from December to February is known as a wet season, which features a heavy rainfall, occasional floods, and overall, depressive weather to live in. Probably the average temperature for the whole Vietnam sits in the mid-20s (celsius) degrees. Also, the critical thing to mention is that the south experiences a monsoon climate, which means half of the year is a wet season.

Prepare for daily rains and constant floods.
<h2><strong>Extra - Bum Guns Everywhere!</strong></h2>
Alright, at first, bum guns may sound like a weird thing, but believe me, once you leave Vietnam, you'll immediately look for the ways to install one in your house. Once you learn how to use it properly and apply enough water pressure, then we're talking about the comfort you simply can't abandon. Bum guns are the best! :)

<hr />

After all being said, Vietnam has its pros and cons, but in my opinion, the pros hugely outweigh the cons. Vietnam is by far my favorite country to live in, and I can proudly call it my second home.

		<Content><![CDATA[<span data-preserver-spaces="true">Are you a type of traveler who genuinely shares an interest in exploring rich Vietnamese history and tradition? Well, if you can positively answer the question, then you will find Vietnam as an attractive place! </span>

<span data-preserver-spaces="true">One of the many reasons is the abundance of temples and pagodas around the whole country sharing the stories of ancestors. I had a chance to explore many hidden spots in Vietnam and learn about the history, but what amazes me the most, is the abundance of Vietnam temples and pagodas. You can stumble upon beautiful temples on each step, even in the remotest areas that will catch your attention. </span>

Since the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Vietnam">history of Vietnam dates 4000 years ago</a>, the fact gives you the idea of how many temples you can explore in Vietnam. I had a very tough task to pick among more than 50 temples I've had a chance to visit during my journey around the country. If I missed any temple and you believe it should be on the list, please add your thought in the section below, and I'd be more than happy to add it. :)

So if you have only a limited time to explore Vietnam, how do you choose which Vietnam pagodas and temples to visit?
<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">#1- Tran Quoc Pagoda - Hanoi</span></strong></h2>
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-5780 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5e6cefcf24266.jpg" alt="Tran Quoc Pagoda - Hanoi" width="1184" height="777" /> <span data-preserver-spaces="true">The majority of travelers land their feet in the capital city of Hanoi when first arriving in Vietnam. The capital is a great choice to start your trip as it will give you a sweet introduction to Vietnamese culture. </span>

<span data-preserver-spaces="true">Also, there are many beautiful areas and things to do in the capital, including exploring the oldest temple located in the heart of West Lake. </span> <span data-preserver-spaces="true">Tran Quoc Pagoda is the complex you can’t miss once you’re wandering around beautiful West Lake. </span>

<span data-preserver-spaces="true">Many magazines listed this authentic Vietnamese pagoda as the most beautiful pagoda or temple in the world, so it’s definitely a place you want to visit. </span> <span data-preserver-spaces="true">Pagoda itself was built around the 6th century under the reign of Emperor Ly Nam De. </span>

<span data-preserver-spaces="true">During the centuries, emperors made many changes around the complex due to security and comfort reasons. Emperors mainly used this temple during holidays while they were relaxing in the company of close associates, friends, and family. </span>

<span data-preserver-spaces="true">Once you set your foot around, you will feel a royalty and vastness of the place. </span> <span data-preserver-spaces="true">The central tower is 15 meters tall, and it features 11 diverse levels. </span>

<span data-preserver-spaces="true">There are few tiny buildings around the complex where you can burn incense and pray as well as a small museum that provides interesting information about that part of history. </span>

<span data-preserver-spaces="true">Since it's a Buddhist pagoda, many locals and foreigners pay a visit on 1st or 15th in the Lunar calendar, so you can expect huge crowds. </span>

<span data-preserver-spaces="true">There is also a specific dress code you have to follow, such as wearing long sleeves and removing shoes when entering. </span> <span data-preserver-spaces="true">Tran Quoc Pagoda is a place you simply can't miss while strolling around West Lake.</span>

I suggest to time your visit around sunset hours since West Lake is the sunset spot in Hanoi. Bring your camera, take some fresh mango and chili salt, and admire the breathtaking views.

<strong>p.s. </strong>Having only 2 days for exploring beautiful Hanoi? Read our <a href="https://vietnamchronicles.com/2-days-in-hanoi">detailed 2 days itinerary</a> and spice your trip with exciting activities.

<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">#2- Bai Dinh Pagoda - Ninh Binh Province</span></strong></h2>
<p id="xaopaAn"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5781 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5e6cf00bd7851.jpg" alt="Bai Dinh Pagoda, Ninh Binh" width="1184" height="787" /></p>
<span data-preserver-spaces="true">Once you start traveling around Vietnam, it’s tough to avoid a place like Ninh Binh, especially Tam Coc or Trang An area. The site looks surreal as it is a home of thousands of limestones, green rice fields, and tiny rivers craving the paths around stunning mountains. </span>

<span data-preserver-spaces="true">The place seems breathtaking, which might be a reason it’s a home of the largest Buddhist complex in Southeast Asia - Bai Dinh Pagoda. </span>

<span data-preserver-spaces="true">Pagoda itself was built around 1000 years ago, but some parts of the Buddhist complex were built just 10 years ago. It gives a complex an unique combination of modern and ancient architecture. The amazing thing you can do while you’re exploring the complex is to climb to the top of the pagoda and enjoy breathtaking views of the surrounding place. </span>

<span data-preserver-spaces="true">The complex is famous for many things and holds many records when it comes to temples and pagodas. Did you know that Bai Dinh pagoda features the biggest bell in Vietnam, weighing 36 tons? </span>

<span data-preserver-spaces="true">Also, there are more than 100 statues around the complex, which says much about the vastness of the complex. Just walking around this pagoda gives you chills as you feel the energy of historical importance. </span>

<span data-preserver-spaces="true">Be sure that you visit Bai Dinh pagoda before 5 pm as they are closing the gates afterward. </span>

<strong>p.s.</strong> Once you're in the Tam Coc area, you should definitely pay a visit to Mua Caves. It's a stunning Buddhist temple that features a 500-stairs climb that will greet you with breathtaking views over the area.

<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">#3- My Son Ruins - Quang Nam Province</span></strong></h2>
<p id="iZzdSmD"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5783 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5e6cf0bed679f.jpg" alt="My Son Sanctuary" width="1133" height="754" /></p>
<span data-preserver-spaces="true">People often compare My Son Ruins to world-famous Angkor Wat, but is it really like that? Well, My Son is listed as the UNESCO World Heritage Site, and it attracts thousands of tourists annually. The complex itself lies in a very tiny area in the mountains located about 50 km southern from Hoi An. </span>

<span data-preserver-spaces="true">My Son Ruins is the cluster of Hindu temples that date from the 4th century. Around the whole complex, you can discover 8 temples and 70 monuments. The majority of the site remains in the ruins partly because the site served as a military base during the war. </span>

<span data-preserver-spaces="true">The best way to visit the ruins is by hiring a car or rent a motorbike from Hoi An or Da Nang. It takes about 1 - 2 hours to reach the site and to explore a whole complex, you will need another few hours. The best time to visit the ruins is in the morning since it's not hot and you can still cover in the shades, and there are not so many tourists around. Not to forget, the entrance price is 150,000 VND (around $7). </span>

<strong>p.s.</strong> While in Quang Nam, don't forget to try their iconic bowl of Mi Quang. If you're looking for cold refreshment drinks, I can't recommend trying their fresh sugar cane juice (Nuoc Mia).

<h2><strong>#8- Cao Dai Temple - Tay Ninh</strong></h2>
<p id="zPrMctt"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5786 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5e6cf3abafbe6.jpg" alt="Cao Dai Temple - Tay Ninh" width="1186" height="776" /></p>
Doing a visa run from Saigon, or looking to explore the surrounding area and get away from the constant bustle of a city? Well, what could be better than visiting majestic Cao Dai Temple located in Tay Ninh (about 100 km northwest from Saigon)? Cao Dai Temple is the newest temple on the list, and its construction was completed in 1955.

It's hard you'll stumble upon a similar temple since this one features the mixture in traditions, which translates to pretty odd but colorful architecture. The temple represents <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caodaism">Caodaism</a>, which is unique to the region.

The unique religion features a blend of various religions, including Islam, Confucianism, Taoism, Christianity, and Buddhism.

Cadoaists share a fascinating perspective stating that all religions are the same, and united they seek for tolerance and peace in the world. A pretty fresh perspective that differs from popular religious views today.

I personally don't follow any religion because of many reasons, but I really appreciate a belief where followers are talking about peace, freedom, and unity. The best aspect of exploring the Cao Dai Temple is observing prayers.

People wear colorful robes, and women sit separated from men. These separations and colorful dresses make the whole praying process fascinating and picturesque. Once you enter the complex, you should follow a strict dress code - cover your shoulders and knees, and remove your shoes to show respect.

<strong>A fascinating fact</strong> - Did you know there are more than 1,000 Cao Dai Temples around Vietnam?

Jade Emperor Pagoda or often called Tortoise Pagoda, is one of the essential cultural temples in Saigon. The complex was built at the beginning of the 20th century by immigrants from Guangzhou province located in China. The story of pagoda started when a regular Chinese man named Luu Minh migrated from mainland China to South Vietnam to work.

As he was a firm believer and follower of Buddhism, he wanted to create a worship place for his daily praying sessions, and that's how this majestic pagoda finds itself in the middle of Saigon. The architecture looks pretty colorful and attractive, and the whole complex spreads over whopping 2,000 square meters.

There are many tiny temples, picturesque statues, beautiful paintings, and worship places where people can pray or simply wonder the beauty of the complex. The complex features three main halls filled with Buddha statues, different gods, tigers, dragons, and other mythical creatures.

Since Jade Emperor Pagoda is an extremely popular temple in Vietnam, especially after <a href="https://english.vietnamnet.vn/fms/vietnam-in-photos/157017/president-obama-visits-ngoc-hoang-temple-in-hcm-city.html">Obama's visit in 2016.</a>, it's imperative to time your visit carefully.

Aim to visit in the early morning and avoid national holidays, or significant dates on Lunar Calendar as pagoda tends to be full. For the dress code, just follow the main rule - cover your knees and shoulders, and you'll be okay.

Phở is the iconic Vietnamese dish that is one of the main symbols of Vietnam. Often enjoyed by locals on breakfast to kickstart their day, this noodle soup is light and full of flavors. We say that it’s a must-try dish when you are visiting Hanoi!

This soup is served in a bowl with a spoon and chopsticks. You will need to use both of them to devour this delicious soup. The soup gets its flavor a broth made from beef bones that are cooked for several hours.

To further intensify the taste, most locals put green onions, bean sprouts, basil, and coriander leaves. In most cases, you will get chili peppers, chili paste to spice up your meal on the table. Also, to neutralize the spiciness of the soup, most vendors will also serve you lime wedges.

The soup will be much tastier, and cheaper than in tourist-oriented restaurants. You can find the best Phở in the Old Quarter for sure, as it is a sort of a mecca for food in Hanoi.

<div class="image_description"><em>Banh Mi - our favorite snack!</em></div>
What Subway sandwiches are in the western hemisphere, <span class="rendered_qtext">Bánh mì is in Vietnam. But, this seemingly simple sandwich is so much more. It has become an art here in Vietnam, especially in Hanoi. Before, it was just an ordinary sandwich that consisted of a French baguette as the base, with butter, ham, or pate as fillings. </span>

<span class="rendered_qtext">With the rise of its popularity though, only the imagination can limit the number of combinations people make with Bánh mì.</span> <span class="rendered_qtext">What exactly goes into the filling of Bánh mì then? Most often, the one that you will get in the morning hours will have freshly fried eggs to kick off your day. Of course, some soy sauce or chili (either in sauce, jelly, or raw format) aren't out of the picture to heat you up a bit! </span>

<span class="rendered_qtext">Other most common ingredients are steamed pork rolls (often seasoned with fish sauce), minced pork or chicken meat, pickled carrots, daikon radish, cucumber, and fresh cilantro. </span>

The name of this noodle soup reflects its actual contents, as it is essentially a rice vermicelli soup with a rainbow of extra ingredients.

<div class="image_description"><em>Banh Duc Nong - one of the rare gooey treats in Vietnam.</em></div>
When you come to Vietnam from the Western countries, you may notice a lack of cheesy and glutinous food around the whole country. Well, we were immensely satisfied when we discovered this dish, as it is one of the rare foods that tick that mark! Bánh Đúc Nóng is a unique dish that originates from Northern Vietnam, but you can also find it all over the other Vietnamese regions.

It is yet another soup, as Vietnam has a lot of amazing soup dishes, but this one is a different beast of its own! Of course, this dish is so much more than goo. It features balanced flavors that are quite distinct, like with every other Vietnamese soup.

The broth of the soup is always made from pork, and the texture is made from glutinous rice flour. From the terminology perspective, "bánh dúc" is the name for the glutinous texture, and "nong" is hot.

Do not mistake this dish for Bánh Đúc, as it is a similar dish, with the same base, but it's not a soup. So, if you see Bánh Đúc on the street food stall, try to ask for the Bánh Đúc Nóng to get this amazing soup served right on your table.

After the broth and the glutinous rice are in the bowl, there come the toppings that add the mentioned distinct flavors to this tasty soup. Usually, the toppings are fried onions, fresh tofu slices, fresh herbs, and minced pork meat cooked with black mushrooms.

The mushrooms balance out the sweetness of the glutinous rice and pork, while the crispy tofu slices and fried onions give that crunchy feel to balance it all out.

To top it all off, the fresh herbs give extra freshness, to sweet, salty, and savory zest. The great thing about this soup is even though different tastes are mixed, everything keeps its individuality, so every spoon may be a bit different!

You can discover this amazing street food all over Hanoi Old Quarter. Just look for the Bánh Đúc sign and you are good to go!

The price for this dish is usually <strong>15,000 to 30,000 VND </strong>(0,64 USD to 1,29 USD).
<h2><strong>#7: Bún ốc</strong></h2>
<img class="size-large wp-image-5827 aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.bun-oc.jpg" alt="Bun Oc with some added pork and beef." width="1024" height="768" />
<div class="image_description"><em>Bun Oc with some added pork and beef.</em></div>
You may absolutely love or hate them, but one is certain - snails are prevalent in Vietnamese cuisine. One such dish, if you are ready to devour it, is Bún ốc. Locals absolutely adore this dish, as it is probably the second most popular breakfast choice, just after Phở soup.

Bún ốc is as traditional as it gets with a broth of strong scent amplified by fried onions, with a soft and naturally sweet taste. Of course, we mustn't forget the rice vermicelli that is inside this soup, which is usually made in small parts and is not separated like your usual Bún.

Usually, both big and small snails can be found in this soup, that are fried to give them that crispy crunch.

Most locals will also put inside some fresh herbs, fried banana, and soy cheese; to give this soup the signature yellow color. You can find different varieties of Bún ốc all over Hanoi, both in fancier restaurants and on the street food stalls.

The price for a bowl of Bún ốc is between <strong>25,000 VND to 45,000 VND</strong> (1 USD to 2 USD).
<h2><strong>#8: </strong><span class="ILfuVd NA6bn"><span class="e24Kjd"><strong>Bún chả</strong> </span></span></h2>
<img class="size-large wp-image-5828 aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.bun-cha.jpg" alt="Bun Cha is a treat to behold." width="1024" height="768" />
<div class="image_description"><em>Bun Cha is a treat to behold.</em></div>
<span class="ILfuVd NA6bn"><span class="e24Kjd">Bún chả is an immensely popular rice noodle dish that originates from Hanoi. Outside of Hanoi, there is a very similar dish with a different name - <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%BAn_th%E1%BB%8Bt_n%C6%B0%E1%BB%9Bng">Bún thịt nướng</a></strong>. Like many other rice noodle dishes, Bún chả is a harmony of different flavors, and is immensely rewarding for your digestive glands! </span></span>

Essentially, <span class="ILfuVd NA6bn"><span class="e24Kjd">Bún chả </span></span>consists of pork meatballs and rice vermicelli that are dunked in a broth made of slightly sweet pork belly slices. Along with the main dish a vibrant dipping sauce (a combination of fish sauce with sugar, vinegar, lemon juice, garlic, and chili), vegetables (such as papaya salad, or carrots, onions, turnip), and fresh herbs are served alongside it.

The idea of this dish is to dunk the herbs into the broth and then take the meat slices and dunk them in the dipping sauce. What you will experience is a pure rainbow of different amazing aromas, that you absolutely have to try!

As this is one of the most popular dishes in Hanoi, expect to find it on every corner! Just look for the sign that says <span class="ILfuVd NA6bn"><span class="e24Kjd">Bún chả, and you're good to go! </span></span>

<span class="ILfuVd NA6bn"><span class="e24Kjd">Bún chả usually costs between <strong>35,000 VND to 45,000 VND</strong> (1,50 USD to 1,93 USD).</span></span>

		<Content><![CDATA[Did you know that Vietnam is the <a href="https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/top-coffee-producing-countries.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">second-largest coffee producer</a> and exporter in the world? That information was a huge yet positive shock for us before arriving in Vietnam, but after a few days, you realize that everyone enjoys their cup of strong Vietnamese coffee!

The relaxing morning walks around bustling cities were very memorable for us since you can see people sitting and chilling on small chairs literally on the street while enjoying the sips of the coffee.

In small streets, you can even smell the taste of the coffee. Coffee in Vietnam is a huge part of the culture, and everyone enjoys their coffee breaks in the morning, afternoon, and in between.

When we first arrived in Vietnam, as coffee lovers, we couldn't help ourselves not to do the same - sitting tiny chairs, observing the constant moving life while enjoying the sips of very delicious and strong coffee. In this article, we want to share all the experiences, observations, and knowledge we've got during our time in Vietnam when we're talking about Vietnamese coffee culture.

Brew yourself a coffee and find a cozy and comfortable place for this read (it's a long one!).
<h2><strong>Vietnamese Coffee Culture - A Brief History of Vietnamese Coffee</strong></h2>
<img class="aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5e78fa0eb5e33.jpg" alt="Vietnamese coffee culture is extremely strong and rooted in traditions. " /> The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_production_in_Vietnam" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">history of Vietnamese coffee</a> dated from the middle of the 19th century when French colonialists introduced aromatic black beans to Vietnam. The industry started with mass-production because colonialists wanted to pump the profits out of the country as fast as possible.

It was working like a charm during the colonial era, but after the 1950s, coffee production started to decline drastically. The majority of coffee fields were situated in Central Highlands, the bordering area with Laos and Cambodia, which was the place of the bloodiest battles during the war.

The war lasted for more than 20 years, and it left the Vietnamese economy on the knees. The coffee fields, potent plants, and equipment were partly destroyed, the people left the area, and unexploded bombs still remain. It was very risky and costly to start with coffee production all over again.

However, the ruling Communist Party at that period decided to invest in coffee production as they saw it as an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%90%E1%BB%95i_M%E1%BB%9Bi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">opportunity for economic recovery</a>. For instance, the coffee production jumped from 0.1% during the war to a whopping 30% some 40 years later.

Nowadays, Vietnam is the second-largest producer and exporter of Robusta coffee beans in the world. The production process of Robusta beans is way cheaper, and beans consist of more caffeine levels, which is ideal for western and fast-paced markets. On the other hand, Arabica beans grow on a higher elevation, so you can find massive fields and farms around beautiful Da Lat and Buon Ma Thuot.

The coffee industry employs more than 3 million locals and drives a steady growth. Almost every country in the world imports Vietnamese coffee since it's affordable without lacking quality. After learning about the coffee culture and its history, it's not a strange thing to smell coffee aroma on every step in Vietnam.

<strong>Storytime:</strong> After our epic <a href="https://vietnamchronicles.com/hanoi-to-saigon">motorbike trip from Hanoi to Saigon</a>, it was time to say goodbye to David and Lovel.

They left for Croatia and I was planning my next trip around Vietnam, of course sitting in one of the tiny coffee shops somewhere in Ho Chi Minh city. I've figured out that I'd love to explore Central Highlands and learn more about the coffee, so I've planned a route from HCMC to Da Lat, Buon Ma Thuot, Pleiku, and Kontum. It's definitely a route for every coffee lover!

The mountainous region features windy roads, mountains touching the clouds and coffee fields surrounding you. It was a blast to drive around the region. Once, when I was leaving Buon Ma Thuot to Kontum, there was a local who was driving extremely fast with me (no traffic around there). We as fast a Chinese backpackers' bike can go for a good 30 minutes until we reached a traffic light in the middle of nowhere.

He said something on Vietnamese and showed a thumbs up, and I returned the same. We didn't know how to talk, but he asked universally understandable word - Ca Phe?

I agreed with a wide smile! <img class="wp-image-5931 size-full aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5e84d3d76829e.jpg" alt="coffee lovers around the country" width="655" height="870" />
<div class="image_description">This local is a LEGEND!</div>
<h2><strong>What is Special About Vietnamese Coffee</strong></h2>
There are two main types of coffee beans - Arabica and Robusta. Arabica requires much more effort to grow since it's only growing in high places, and its maintenance requires loads of resources. Also, Arabica has up to 2% of the caffeine in the beans which translates into a mild and pleasant cup of coffee. Robusta, on the other hand, features a bitter taste and, overall, a potent coffee.

Central Highlands serves as the ideal ground for growing Robusta beans that feature around 3% of caffeine levels. Vietnamese people usually add broken ice and sweetened condensed milk to their coffee. Ice dilutes the strength and bitterness while condensed milk creates a sweet taste and creamy texture. As you know, Vietnamese coffee is everywhere, but still, it's not so popular around the world.

What is the reason behind it? Well, Vietnam exports coffee beans to huge corporations that repack and make a cheap instant coffee ready for resale.

Basically, Vietnam sells a tremendous amount of coffee beans at a low price to companies like Starbucks or Nestle, that later pack the same coffee in their brands and enjoy massive profits.
<h2><strong>How to Prepare Vietnamese Coffee At Home</strong></h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jTbiGpXss7I" width="764" height="430" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>

Whenever you want to prepare a strong and delicious coffee, you have to use 'phin' - an aluminum filter filled with coffee beans that go on the top of the cup. Once you prepare everything and spill hot water over the coffee, the long preparation process starts.

Enjoy watching a drop falling after a drop until your drink is ready. Vietnamese people don't use filter paper while preparing the coffee, which preserves all the essential oils from the beans. That process results in a specific aroma and ultra potency that will kickstart even the worst days. :D Don't be surprised when you take your first sip by the sweetness and creamy texture.

People add sweetened condensed milk to their coffee, but you can also order one without if you don't prefer so much sugar in your coffee (we will talk about different coffee types). The French colonialists enjoyed coffee with milk so much, but the lack of supply made them bringing the milk to Vietnam.

Since I was living with locals in Nghe An Province (<a href="https://vietnamchronicles.com/starlight-english-center-vietnam" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">volunteering as an English teacher</a>), coffee drinking was a ritual for us. I've learned to prepare my own coffee using different methods. Here's the process of preparing a <a href="https://vietnamchronicles.com/vietnamese-drip-coffee-guide" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">traditional Vietnamese drip coffee</a>, so you can make one by yourself!

Now when you're familiar with the process of making a coffee and its fascinating history, it's time to learn more. Check out the most<strong> popular coffee types around the country ADD LINK</strong>, where to drink it, and how much it costs.

<hr />

If you're a coffee-lover, like me, believe me, you'll spend much time exploring cozy coffee shops around Vietnam. There is something special about the coffee culture and you'll get it from the first sight.

Locals love their coffee and if you ask a local for a coffee break, there is hardly any chance you'll get turned down.

		<Content><![CDATA[Hue was the former grand capital of Vietnam, and nowadays, the city radiates with history, culture, and delicious cuisine. Travelers usually follow a regular tourist route exploring the Imperial City, partying at the pub street, and exploring bustling markets near the Perfume River. In my opinion, Hue is a beautiful city, and you can learn a lot about Vietnamese history, but the number of tourist crowds slightly kills the vibe.

Looking to explore a bit off-the-beaten-path? Head over to Ho Thuy Tien Abandoned Waterpark in Hue. Exploring abandoned sites gives me weird goosebumps, partly because of history, partly because of a creepy vibe.

Located about 10 km south from the city's center, Ho Thuy Tien waterpark was a very bizarre and fascinating experience during our <a href="https://vietnamchronicles.com/hanoi-to-saigon">Vietnam motorbike trip</a>. It's officially closed to visitors, but money in Vietnam can get you far.

We've witnessed pretty creative schemes locals and guards are pulling to extract money from tourists. After a bit of hesitation, and us trying to find a different way through the surrounding forest, we've finally made it to the park.

If you're looking to explore Ho Thuy Tien waterpark soon, keep reading our bizarre, but fun experience.
<h2><strong>Getting to Ho Thuy Tien Waterpark</strong></h2>
Locating the park was the easy part - everyone knows about it, but getting into the park was a tricky one. People share mixed experience while getting in the park, as well as I. I've been exploring the park in 2018. and once in early 2020.

The first time, it was a bit tough to get in, but after trying to find another way through the forest, and failing, we managed to bribe a guard (100.000 VND for three people) to get in.

<strong>Arm yourself with knowledge: </strong><a href="https://vietnamchronicles.com/scams-in-vietnam">Avoid these 36 most common scams in Vietnam</a> The second time wasn't possible to get in.

We tried to bribe a guard, but nothing worked. One guy who was getting out of the park showed us an alternative way, and the guard spotted us there and started yelling at us. My girlfriend tried to negotiate with him (she is Vietnamese), but the guy started to be aggressive and yelled at her, so we figured out it's not our day.

Anyway, I hope you're luckier than me, and you'll get to the park without the problem.

<em>Here's the location of the park on the map, and you can directly set navigation to reach it:</em>

<iframe style="border: 0;" tabindex="0" src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d7654.477531309104!2d107.57792284206744!3d16.412695754673585!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x3141a38bd2c560e3%3A0xe7f19deff74c9e9a!2sThuy%20Tien%20Lake!5e0!3m2!1shr!2shr!4v1585337268310!5m2!1shr!2shr" width="600" height="450" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" aria-hidden="false"></iframe>

<em>Also, here's the screenshot with a detailed explanation:</em> <img class="wp-image-5870 size-full aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5e7b86c587b8a.jpg" alt="How to get to abandoned waterpark in Hue" width="1256" height="877" />
<div class="image_description">You'll find a security guard on the first entrance who's not always happy to let you pass. Alternatively, on the second entrance, you'll avoid a security guard but be ready to play mouse and cat.</div>
Get out of the city until reaching Thuy Tien Road. Continue driving until you see a small security outpost. Arm yourself with patience, and don't move away if the guard starts yelling at you. Learn how to say a few numbers on Vietnamese, so you can negotiate directly with him. Just be persistent, and he should eventually let you in.

The alternative entrance is an easy bet as there is no security guard there, and you can easily sneak in with your bike. We didn't have luck as at the time we sneaked in; the security guy saw us as he was driving around the park.

Once in the park, I've felt a rush of paranoia as you're playing cat and mouse with the guard, but after a while, you understand that 50.000 VND can solve every problem. :)

Okay, so now you know how to get in the park, so hopefully, it's your lucky day, and you'll have a chance to explore the beauty of Ho Thuy Tien waterpark.
<h2><strong>Dark History of Ho Thuy Tien Waterpark</strong></h2>
<img class="wp-image-5886 size-full aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5e7e4f9bf1fb1.jpg" alt="Reaching the dragon! " width="1130" height="848" />
<div class="image_description">If you're driving a bike, luckily, you can park the bike next to a small local shop overlooking the dragon.</div>
<strong>Why the park is abandoned?</strong>

In short, Ho Thuy Tien waterpark was an <a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ho-thuy-tien">enormous and ambitious project</a> that only partially seen the lights. The park supposed to be the largest waterpark in the region featuring windy slides, a massive lake, thematic parks, swimming pools, and an enormous dragon overlooking the lake.

Company Hue Tourism was managing the development, and the budget was set to a whopping $3 billion VND. The developers postponed the opening date time after time, so the local government decided to announce the opening in 2004. while the park was only partially completed.

The park has never seen the full competition, and the developers ran out of the money in 2006. Seven years later, the company named HACO bought the park and planned to create an innovative idea - eco-tourism site.

However, it never has seen the light either, and since then, the park stays abandoned. The story touches the home, like many projects in Croatia, due to budget mismanagement and corruption. Anyway, on our fortune or misfortune, we have a beautiful yet creepy place to discover.
<h2><strong>Things to Do Around the Abandoned Waterpark</strong></h2>
If you get in by the motorbike, you'll have a lot of fun. There is a concrete path leading to the Dragon, but also you can do a nice off-road driving around. It was amusing and refreshing to try our bikes without sharing the road with a thousand people.

Don't worry if you forget drinks or snacks as there are sellers in the park where you can get your refreshment. Also, you can park a bike, and these ladies will watch it for you. Be cautious as we heard stories where people got their bikes or parts stolen.

Head over to Dragon that sits in the middle of the lake overlooking the abandoned structures and lush nature. You can climb to the Dragon's head and enjoy the view.

Be careful as there are much trash, glass, and debris inside the Dragon and around the park. Wear shoes to avoid injuries.

Oh, not to forget - some people claim there are crocodiles in the lake.

<em>We're not sure if that's a fairytale or a real story, but here's the video from 2014. proving some crocodiles were residing in the park:</em>

		<Content><![CDATA[We've traveled from Hanoi to Saigon and then from Saigon to Hanoi again. There are still so many places you can explore northern from Hanoi (<a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/ha-giang-loop" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ha Giang loop</a>) and southern from Saigon, but if you're on limited time, this Vietnam motorbike route is perfect for 3 - 4 weeks!

Since we were writing this motorbike itinerary during our first Vietnam trip in 2018., we've completed a few more road trips through Cambodia, Laos, and South Vietnam.

You can find all of these experiences and separate routes through the article. Keep reading as we're going to talk about amazing, stunning, and breathtaking places! I know it will be tough to pick the locations if you have a limited time, as in every place, you'll want to stay longer!

So let's start! :)
<h2><strong>Vietnam Motorbike Route &amp; Detailed Map</strong></h2>
The map above shows the exact route we took during our motorbike trip. We have a few more stops than usual since we stayed in a small industrial town Cau Giat where Antonio was volunteering as an English teacher. The city features an authentic local lifestyle, deserted beach, lovely hiking trails, and gives you a glimpse of local culture.

Also, we've added a few day trips we did, mainly from central Vietnam. Check out our epic <a href="https://vietnamchronicles.com/hanoi-to-saigon" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hanoi to Saigon road trip</a> and learn about specific routes, places to visit, accommodation options, budget, and more.
<h2><strong>#1- Hanoi</strong></h2>
<img class="aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.hanoi-at-night.jpg" alt="Hanoi at night" /> For the majority of people, Hanoi is the first destination in Vietnam. It's a perfect destination for people who're interested in learning as much as possible about the Vietnamese culture or people who decided to travel around Vietnam on a motorbike.

The motorbike market is enormous in Hanoi, and the bikes tend to be cheaper to buy than in Saigon. People usually buy their bikes in Hanoi for a lower price and later sell it in Saigon for the same price.

If you're not a bike expert, be sure to read our detailed checklist before <a href="https://vietnamchronicles.com/buy-motorbike-in-vietnam" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">buying a motorbike in Vietnam</a> to be sure you're not driving a crap that will leave you in the middle of nowhere.

Hanoi is a huge city, and it will give you surprising insights into Vietnamese culture. Many people call Hanoi a huge village as it's a city with a population of more than 8 million people, but still, the local vibe is very present.

You will see locals doing their things, not minding tourists. Hanoi is a great city to dip yourself into <a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/vietnamese-street-food" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vietnamese street food</a>. Also, there are some beautiful places around the city to explore and museums that will educate you about the history and will help you in understanding the people and culture.

People usually spend around 4 - 5 days exploring the city's attractions and cuisine. After you're done with Hanoi, there are a few ways to continue your trip.

One is going on the north exploring Sapa and driving a northern loop, and the other is to visit stunning Halong Bay that is just on the corner!

<h2><strong>#2- Halong Bay</strong></h2>
<img class="aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.halong-bay.jpg" alt="stunning Ha Long bay" /> If you're lacking time to ride a northern loop, but you want to experience the magic of the north, then head to stunning Halong Bay. The place is one of the natural worlds wonders as the bay is the home of more than 1000 limestone islands.

My advice is to get a motorbike there (rents are very cheap, and the average price is around 100,000 VND per day) as you will have total freedom while exploring the place.

The other option, which is a bit more expensive, is booking a boat tour around the islands. The tours usually last for a night, and you will have a chance to experience one of the most secluded beaches around the bay.

For hiking lovers, don't forget to check out the <a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/halong-bay-vietnam" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bai Tho Mountain</a> in the center of the city. The hike is not so challenging, and it takes only around 45 minutes to get to the top, but the views over a whole bay are merely breathtaking and worth the struggle of getting up!
<h2><strong>#3- Ninh Binh (Tam Coc &amp; Trang An)</strong></h2>
<img class="aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.ninh-binh.jpg" alt="Top of Mua Cave in Tam Coc" /> For people who enjoy nature and infinite drives around stunning views, the Ninh Binh area is the perfect spot. Ninh Binh area, especially Tam Coc and Trang An are usually called Halong Bay on earth.

The reason for the name is that the place is a home of hundreds of limestones in the middle rice paddies. It's awe-inspiring as you can explore the place with a bicycle or motorbike without paying a massive price for a boat tour, and also you're free while driving and exploring around.

The area has many attractions, but also many hidden places where you can just lose yourself in the beauty the area offers. If you're an adventurous soul like me, don't forget to bring a tent and camping equipment. Also, simple picnic equipment and food near the river in the middle of the rice fields will give you an unforgettable experience in this beautiful place.

My advice is to rent a motorbike and check out some of the <a href="https://vietnamchronicles.com/vietnam-temples-guide" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">greatest Vietnam temples</a>, try some delicious food (their goat dishes are more than delicious!), take a boat tour through the caves and then just relax in the middle of the rice fields while wandering the stunning views around countless limestones!
<h2><strong>#4- Phong Nha</strong></h2>
<img class="aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.phong-nha.jpg" alt="Curvy road in Phong Nha" /> Heading south from Ninh Binh is a bit monotone route as it gives you only the experience of the rural countryside. Don't get me wrong, I think everyone should experience the countryside and interact with beautiful people there. If you're on limited time and you want to explore most of Vietnam, then I advise you to head over to Phong Nha.

This part of the country is a bit laid down, but tourism is popping out like crazy in the town. This place is the home of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hang_S%C6%A1n_%C4%90o%C3%B2ng" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">biggest cave in the world</a> with a whole ecosystem, but it's accessible only to people who have permits and equipment that costs about $5,000.

Anyway, the place has stunning scenery, and a vast national park is just around the corner. The national park is the home of the Paradise cave and many windy roads overlooking the limestones, rivers, and lively countryside. We stayed two days in Phong Nha, but we'd like to spend at least a week there as the scenery and a laid-back life recharge your energy for the trip ahead.

Also, not to forget, the road to Phong Nha is terrific, but a bit challenging as you're going inland heading to Laos border. The road you'll be probably taking is an infamous Ho Chi Minh Road, which leads you through stunning scenery.

It will take you a lot of time as you will probably stop so many times to admire the view and take a picture or two!
<h2><strong>#5- Hue</strong></h2>
<img class="aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.imperial-city-hue.jpg" alt="Imperial city of Hue" /> Hue is an imperial city of Vietnam that was once a capital during the reign of the Nguyen dynasty.

The city was in ruins during the Vietnam war, but locals and international investments helped the city to get on feet again. Hue radiates with a beautiful vibe, especially during the night, but it is a bit touristic, and the prices are set accordingly to tourists.

I advise you to visit an imperial city. Do it in the morning since it can take a few hours to walk around it. It's a massive complex with a lot of information that will give you great insights into that part of history. The entrance ticket costs 150,000 VND.

Another great place around Hue is the <a href="https://vietnamchronicles.com/abandoned-waterpark-hue" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ho Thuy Tien abandoned water park</a> that is located on the skirts of the city. <img class="aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.abandoned-park-in-hue.jpg" alt="Abandoned park in Hue" /> The place is so beautiful, and you will get that vibe instantly when you get there. Sometimes it can be tough to get there as there is a security guy on the doors, and he will act like there is no way to enter, but just give him a bit of money, and he will let you in with a wide smile on his face.

Also, inside the park, there is a local lady selling beverages and many people exploring the place each day, so the place doesn't look abandoned at all. It was my favorite place in and around Hue.
<h2><strong>#6- Da Nang</strong></h2>
<img class="aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.my-khe-beach.jpg" alt="My Khe beach in Da Nang" /> Da Nang is by far my favorite city in the whole of Vietnam (I've been living in Da Nang for almost a year), if not in a whole SEA. The city lies on the coast, and I usually call it 'Vietnamese Miami'.

I would say that the city has a perfect balance of nature and cool things to explore and do. There are many mountains, stunning beaches, scenic roads that can be found just on the skirts of the city.

When you're in the city, don't forget to check the Marble Mountain, <a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/son-tra-peninsula" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Son Tra Peninsula</a> and also, rent a bike to drive through an iconic Hai Van Pass.

The food is fantastic there, and it differs a bit from the northern cuisine, so don't forget to try their specialty called Mi Quang and Bun Bo Hue. If you find yourself in the city during the weekend, head over to Dragon Bridge at 9 pm to see a fire-spitting show there.

Coffee culture is a massive part of daily life in Da Nang for locals and expats. Coffee is always potent and delicious, so it will keep you awake and alert.

If you're coming to Da Nang to work or relax, check out the <a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/working-cafes-in-da-nang" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">best working cafes in Da Nang</a>.

<h2><strong>#7- Hoi An</strong></h2>
<img class="aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.hoi-an.jpg" alt="Hoi An ancient town" /> Hoi An is a small town with the old town core that was built during French colonization, so it looks like a small French village. It sounds lovely, but if you're not ready for being in an overcrowded little town, then maybe you won't enjoy the city. It is a magical city during the night as countless lanterns, and many boats are floating on rivers around.

Hoi An is usually called 'Vietnamese Venice' as many small islands and rivers are crossing and dividing the town. Try out their food market for a delicious specialty, and don't forget to try their Mi Xao - fried noodles with many spices and vegetables.

Hoi An is just about 30 km south of Da Nang, and it has many homestays and hostels in the middle of the rice fields. It's a perfect way to relax and recharge your batteries for the trip that is in front of you since you might take an inland route, which is very challenging at times.
<h2><strong>#8- Kon Tum</strong></h2>
<img class="aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.kon-tum-bridge.jpg" alt="Kong Lor Bridge in Kontum" /> Not many tourists visit Kon Tum, but it's one of my highlights in the whole of Vietnam! It's a city located in the middle of the Highlands and you can get there from Hoi An. The distance is around 300 km, but the trip can last a whole day since you're driving through scenic windy and mountainous roads and the weather conditions are totally unpredictable at times.

Prepare yourself for a trip by getting enough food and extra gas in the bottles as there are parts on the road where there is not a single sign of any civilization. The trail is beautiful as you will stumble stunning mountains, windy roads, random rivers and lakes, and few waterfalls that pop up out of nowhere.

The city itself is impressive as it's a home of many ethnic groups, and you don't need any extra permits to get there. We were just sitting in the countryside and observing the lifestyle of the ethnic people. These people are thrilled and very welcoming to foreigners. Also, a few museums are showing the history of Kon Tum and ethnic groups in Vietnam.

After a whole day of exploration, check out the food market in the city center to get some delicious soup and glass of their famous Che (bean cream)! Also, don't forget to try their coffee as once you get to the highlands, you will notice coffee fields all around. Coffee has a different taste than in the north, any, in my opinion, is by far more delicious and higher quality.

The majority of Vietnamese coffee is Robusta, but around Kon Tum, and Highlands in general, there are a lot of Arabica beans.

If you're looking for an <a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/vietnamese-drip-coffee-guide" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">authentic traditional Vietnamese coffee</a>, Kon Tum is the place to be.
<h2><strong>#9- Qui Nhon</strong></h2>
<img class="aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.quy-nhon.jpg" alt="Qui Nhon from Top" /> Some people might be overwhelmed by the countryside and mountains, and they miss the beach vibe. If that's the case with you, then head over to coast again to a coastal city Qui Nhon. It's a fascinating city that has similarities to Da Nang but without tourist crowds. A perfect place to chill for a few days to recoup the energy. The city is becoming more and more popular as you will see resorts are popping out each month.

The beaches around the place are so amazing, and also, there is a desert island with so many sandy beaches and fisherman villages around. Few places around the city are perfect for hiking as while you reach the top, breathtaking looks over the whole city will award you. A pretty laid back city with not so many things to do except relaxing on the beach, eating delicious seafood, and enjoying a cup of Vietnamese coffee.
<h2><strong>#10- Nha Trang</strong></h2>
<img class="aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.nha-trang-local-part.jpg" alt="Local part of Nha Trang" /> The next awesome city that is stretching along the southern coast is called Nha Trang. It is a fantastic city if you're looking for wild nightlife and partying at the beach, but also, the place is surrounded by a surreal landscape featuring many islands, peninsulas, and stunning roads.

Don't forget to try their iconic seafood! If you're looking for a fantastic adventure, then do <a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/snorkeling-in-nha-trang" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">snorkeling in Nha Trang</a>. There are a few natural heavens for divers, and it's a thing to do once in Nha Trang.
<h2><strong>#11- Buon Ma Thuot</strong></h2>
<img class="aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.bmt_.jpg" alt="Mountains around Buon Ma Thuot" /> Are you a coffee addict? Believe me, <a href="https://vietnamchronicles.com/vietnamese-coffee-culture" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vietnamese coffee</a> is one of the most delicious and most potent coffees I had a chance to try.

Buon Ma Thuot is a city of Central Highlands, and its second name is 'the capital of coffee in Vietnam'. The city didn't get the name by accident! The coffee is terrific there as this area is one of the biggest coffee producers in the whole of Vietnam. The city itself doesn't have many exciting things to do except stunning landscape, ultra-delicious coffee, and fantastic food at night.

Coffee lovers should check out this city as there is a vast selection of beans, and also, you can learn so many things about the coffee and way of preparation there.
<h2><strong>#12- Da Lat</strong></h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jTbiGpXss7I" width="764" height="430" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>

Ah, that Da Lat! When you talk with locals and ask them about their favorite place in Vietnam, the majority of them will tell you about Da Lat.

The city is located in the middle of the mountains and with few lakes in the center of the city, it looks very peaceful. The coffee is also very amazing there, and you can find many places with stunning views to enjoy your coffee in Da Lat.

Also, traditional Vietnamese food and Korean food are trendy in Da Lat, so foodie lovers will enjoy it. The city is called 'the city of the eternal spring' as the weather is chilly during the whole year.

During the day, it's charming weather, but in the mornings and during the night, the temperatures will be lower. Don't go there without long sleeves as you'll be freezing like me. :)
<h2><strong>#13- Mui Ne/Phan Thiet</strong></h2>
<img class="aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.mui-ne.jpg" alt="Beach in Mui Ne" /> Mui Ne is a small place that set its borders on the southern coast of Vietnam, around 200 km away from Saigon (HCMC). If you're looking for partying with locals and foreigners, that's the place you want to head!

Also, there are many cheap options when it comes to resorts and bungalows for people who want to relax a bit. The town is widely known for its huge waves and perfect winds, which attract thousands of surfers and windsurfers.

You can learn to surf or windsurf there for a very affordable price. Also, don't forget to try their seafood, especially in a local restaurant. The place is filled with massage shops, so if you're driving a motorbike, believe me, you will need a message here and there.

If you're coming from Nha Trang, be sure that you visit a small city called Phan Rang. The food is authentic, and the city is known as the capital of kitesurfing in Vietnam. Check out our experience while <a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/phan-rang-kitesurfing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kitesurfing in Phan Rang</a> to get a better idea of the place. They have a vast selection of massages, so it's up to you to choose the one you prefer the most. Also, the place is the home of Red and White sand dunes. Literally, this place is set in the middle of the desert, and it's very stunning to visit.

Be careful if you're riding a motorbike as there is a known police blockade between Red and White dunes, and they are targeting foreigners to get the bribes that are usually not small. Always ask travelers who're around the area about the police situation and learn <a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/vietnamese-police-guide" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how to deal with Vietnamese police</a>.
<h2><strong>#14- Ho Chi Minh City (Saigon)</strong></h2>
<img class="aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.saigon-at-night.jpg" alt="Reaching Saigon was the end of our motorbike trip in Vietnam" /> Saigon or Ho Chi Minh City is the biggest city in Vietnam with whooping 10 million people living in. The city is very modern and doesn't look like any other city in Vietnam. Saigon is the economic capital of Vietnam, and the city is very developed in some parts. However, there are many places where you can experience local Vietnamese culture. Ho Chi Minh City features a wild nightlife and excellent living standards, especially for expats.

The traffic is exceptionally crazy there, so be extra careful when riding a motorbike as there are millions of motorcycles around. The good thing to visit there is a War Remnants Museum that will teach you so much about the history of war and will give you a good knowledge of the people and culture today.

Be aware as the museum presents very vivid pictures and scenes, and you will feel the emotion.

I personally didn't like Saigon so much, so I can't tell you more about it since I've stayed for only 2 days and start my journey to the north one more time.

<hr />

Exploring Vietnam by a motorbike was by far one of our best and most bonding experience so far. If you're planning to visit Vietnam anytime soon, and have at least 3 weeks, don't hesitate and explore the country by bike. You can use our Vietnam motorbike route when planning your own itinerary, or you can simply add or remove some places from the route. If you have more time, we really suggest exploring West Ho Chi Minh Road!

		<Content><![CDATA[While Battambang is the third-largest city in Cambodia, it is a very sleepy and tranquil city compared to what you may experience in Vietnam. The surroundings of the city are immensely beautiful, as just a short ride out from the city, you will marvel at amazing sights of green rice paddies stretching out on the horizon. More often than not, these rice paddies are towered upon by limestone hills, each one of them has its own story of how it came to be. Today, we will focus on the Phom Sampeau, which is the perfect example of how Cambodia is sometimes a land of contradictions.

You will explore the recent bloody history of this area in the Killing Caves, while being amazed at how nature has regained its grasp over here, on this short day trip from Battambang, So, without further ado, let's learn something about the Phnom Sampeau, and why should you visit this amazing site while you're in Battambang!
<h2><strong>More About Phnom Sampeau</strong></h2>
<img class="size-large wp-image-5964 aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.phnom-sampeau.jpg" alt="Phnom Sampeau certainly resembles a ship." width="1024" height="685" />
<div class="image_description" style="text-align: center;"><em>Phnom Sampeau certainly resembles a ship.</em></div>
Phnom Sampeau is a limestone hill that has numerous caves to explore. You can instantly recognize it for the golden temple on top of it, that you can see from the distance. We would love to delve into the folklore of this amazing landmark. First, from the terminology perspective, we can split the name of this hill into two pieces:
<ul>
 	<li><em>Phnom </em>means hill</li>
 	<li><em>Sampeau </em>means ship</li>
</ul>
Now, there is one short and cryptic legend that connects to the creation of this hill, and how it got its name. This is the legend of Princess Neang Rumsay Sok. The legend goes that the titular princess was rejected by her love, Prince Reach Kol. He rejected her because he went on to fight a huge crocodile, Athun; who was terrorizing the land. The Prince was swallowed by the crocodile, and when all hope seemed to be lost, the Princess dropped her hair down in the water. Her hair dried the water down, which petrified the crocodile.

Athun has essentially become a limestone hill, Phnom Sampeau. Well, the legend surrounding this place is certainly interesting, and the site itself continues this tradition!
<h2>How To Get to Phnom Sampeau</h2>
Getting to Phnom Sampeau is easy enough, especially if you have mobile data on your phone. It's just a <strong>15-kilometer ride southwest of Battambang</strong>, and the road to there is hard to miss. Just connect to Road 57, and you will see the hill with a golden pagoda in the distance. May that be your main piece of orientation.

<em>Here is the map slice to show you how to get there from Battambang!</em>
<p id="qHkNhpU"><img class="wp-image-5900 size-full aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.img_5e7e64b3af388.jpg" alt="The route from Battambang to Phnom Sampeau is pretty straightforward; if you stick to the main road!" width="1149" height="760" /></p>
As you can see, the route from Battambang to Phnom Sampeau is pretty straightforward; if you stick to the main road! Of course, being passionate adventurers, we didn't go there by this route. When we were doing a day trip from Battambang to Phnom Sampeau and its Killing Caves; we first wanted to see Phnom Banan, a ruined temple to the south of Phnom Sampeau.

It is also located on the limestone hill, but getting from there to Phnom Sampeau isn't so straightforward. <img class="size-large wp-image-5901 aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.phnom-sampeau-alternate-route.jpg" alt="The alternate route to Phnom Sampeau." width="1024" height="685" />
<div class="image_description" style="text-align: center;"><em>The alternate route to Phnom Sampeau.</em></div>
In the end, we ended up splitting up in two groups and riding on the muddy dirt road tracks to avoid paying for the entrance fee. Albeit it took us a while to get to the hill, it sure is an amazing experience riding with 115cc scooters on a muddy path. Not to mention the view on the Phnom Sampov hill, with the golden pagoda on the top, which is simply breathtaking.

Sometimes, straying off from the planned path rewards you immensely! <img class="wp-image-5902 size-large aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.phnom-sampeau-pagoda.jpg" alt="Phnom Sampeau is distinctive enough by its golden pagoda at the top." width="1024" height="685" />
<div class="image_description" style="text-align: center;"><em>Phnom Sampeau is distinctive enough by its golden pagoda at the top.</em></div>
Once you get to the bottom of the hill, you will encounter a small village that seems like it was transformed by the tourism potential of this area; both for nature and history tourism alike. Lots of people come to gather here before dusk to see the bats burst out from the Bat Cave, but more on that later. <img class="size-large wp-image-5969 aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.phnom-sampeau-village.jpg" alt="The village below Phnom Sampeau." width="1024" height="685" />
<div class="image_description" style="text-align: center;"><em>The village below Phnom Sampeau.</em></div>
One thing to keep in mind is that if you prefer to go through the bumpy road up Phnom Sampeau, you will need to go to the nearby "tourism office" and pay <strong>2 USD for the passage</strong> by the guardhouse at the bottom of the hill. Also, behind this office, there are 700 steep steps that you can take instead to the top of the hill. We took the road route, as we were pretty low on time, thanks to our previous endeavor!

<strong>Note: </strong><em>if you don't have a motorbike, go with tuk-tuk from Battambang to Phnom Sampeau, and you can ask for a motorbike driver to ride you to the top and back for 1 USD, as tuk-tuks are not allowed on the road to the top. Not that you would actually make it up the steep road to the top.</em>

The first station of this day trip from Battambang are the Killing Caves, so prepare for a pretty unsettling, yet very important history lesson!
<h2><strong>The Killing Caves of Battambang</strong></h2>
<img class="size-large wp-image-5953 aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.killing-caves-battambang.jpg" alt="The Killing Caves of Battambang - both the place of grim tragedy, and natural wonder." width="1024" height="685" />
<div class="image_description" style="text-align: center;"><em>The Killing Caves of Battambang - both the place of a grim tragedy and a natural wonder.</em></div>
Just 250 meters up the road, you will locate this infamous Khmer Rouge execution site. Here, the Khmer Rouge regime committed horrifying acts of violence on the Cambodian people. Local estimates tell us that some <strong>10,000 people lost their lives at this spot</strong> during the regime. We don't want to delve deep on the Khmer Rouge regime and its impact on Cambodia here, but here is a post <strong><a href="https://www.history.com/topics/cold-war/the-khmer-rouge">about Khmer Rouge </a></strong>if you want to learn more. <img class="size-large wp-image-5955 aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.killling-caves-entrance.jpg" alt="The entrance to the Killing Caves." width="1024" height="685" />
<div class="image_description" style="text-align: center;"><em>The entrance to the Killing Caves.</em></div>
<strong><em>Note: </em></strong><em>if you are horrified by depictions of cruelty and violence, then we suggest that you move to the next section. In the next few paragraphs, we will show the exterior and the interior of the Killing Caves of Battambang; where you can also see the skulls of the victims. We show this content with the utmost respect for the victims of the Khmer Rouge regime.</em>

Just as you enter the site, you will see a few Buddhist shrines and the amazing viewpoints on the land below the hill. Near the Killing Caves, you will see statues that show atrocities done on people on this site. One cannot imagine that all of this happened a bit more than 40 years ago! <img class="size-large wp-image-5956 aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.khmer-rouge-torture.jpg" alt="Statues depicting Khmer Rouge torture methods." width="1024" height="685" />
<div class="image_description" style="text-align: center;"><em>Statues depicting Khmer Rouge torture methods.</em></div>
You can see a daylight shaft at the entrance of the caves. Khmer Rouge soldiers would round up people in front of this spot, then bludgeon them to death, and throw them into the abyss below. The caves eventually filled up with corpses, so the new victims actually didn't die of the impact.

They would starve to death after some time. Khmer Rouge actually used separate caves for adult and children executions. <img class="size-large wp-image-5958 aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.killing-cave-entrance.jpg" alt="The stairs leading to the Killing Caves." width="1024" height="685" />
<div class="image_description" style="text-align: center;"><em>The stairs leading to the Killing Caves.</em></div>
Take the Naga stairs down into the cave and you will find a memorial site inside. There is a Reclining Buddha statue inside and a memorial glass with the skulls of the victims inside, as a sign of respect.

Many Cambodian local people come here to pay their respects to the dead, as this is also a popular place of pilgrimage. <img class="size-large wp-image-5962 aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.reclining-buddha.jpg" alt="The reclining Buddha statue." width="1024" height="685" />

<div class="image_description" style="text-align: center;"><em>The skulls of the Killing Caves victims.</em></div>
<strong><em>Note: </em></strong><em>Remove your shoes when you enter the memorial site inside the cave to show respect to the local customs and victims.</em>

During the late afternoon, someone will usually ring the bell in one of the shrines nearby to signalize that it is time to go. After all, those who are not with us need their peace, it is said. <img class="size-large wp-image-5957 aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.killing-caves-viewpoint.jpg" alt="The amazing view from the Killing Caves." width="1024" height="685" />
<div class="image_description" style="text-align: center;"><em>The amazing view from the Killing Caves.</em></div>
Well, visiting this place was really a punch in the gut. It is a place of a grim tragedy that is reclaimed back by nature. At this site of many atrocities, you are surrounded by wonderful viewpoints on the greenery below.

This evokes feelings of both disgust and awe, which is a true contradiction; a thing I mentioned at the beginning of the post. After all, Cambodians believe that joy is the best way to move past tragedy.

We must say that they are doing pretty well with that. After educative transportation to the grim history of Cambodia, let's explore some caves in Phnom Sampeau!
<h2><strong>Pkar Slar Cave</strong></h2>
<img class="size-large wp-image-5946 aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.pkar-slar-cave.jpg" alt="Come during the right light conditions, and Pkar Slar cave will amaze you!" width="1024" height="685" />
<div class="image_description" style="text-align: center;"><em>Come during the right light conditions, and Pkar Slar cave will amaze you!</em></div>
After you leave the Killing Caves, continue up the road and park near the summit of the hill. There are cave grounds, filled with stalls, and a group of sneaky and cute group of macaques! Pkar Slar cave is very small, albeit it has a specific atmosphere due to the Buddhist shrine inside. When we were exploring the cave, there was a lovely scene in front of our eyes.

A woman was meditating in front of the Buddha statue, and the sun rays burst through the cave opening. Also, you will notice many <em>"tour guides"</em> who will guide you for a minute or two through the cave and ask you for money.

We say that you help them out with a small tip. Now it's time to get to the top of the hill!
<h2><strong>Wat Sampeau</strong></h2>
<img class="size-large wp-image-5947 aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.wat-sampeau.jpg" alt="Wat Sampeau, the golden temple." width="1024" height="685" />
<div class="image_description" style="text-align: center;"><em>Wat Sampeau, the golden temple.</em></div>
Near the Pkar Slar cave grounds, you can take the steps to the temple grounds located at the top of Phnom Sampeau. The number of macaques will drastically rise up, and it is fun to observe what this funny bunch is up to!

These temple grounds offer a very zen atmosphere, with Buddhist monks praying and looking for offerings, locals giving offerings, and lots of amazing and mysterious architecture.

If you are interested in learning more about temples in this region, here is a lovely read on <strong><a href="https://vietnamchronicles.com/vietnam-temples-guide">temples in Vietnam</a></strong>! <img class="size-large wp-image-5948 aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.macaque.jpg" alt="This macaque is up to no good!" width="1024" height="685" />
<div class="image_description" style="text-align: center;"><em>This macaque is up to no good!</em></div>
We also saw a lot of kids role-playing swordsmen with wooden swords. They were bro-fisting us all the time! It was good to be on their good side, and not to feel the wrath of the swordsmen! <img class="size-large wp-image-5949 aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.swordsmen.jpg" alt="Little swordsmen in the flow of their training." width="1024" height="685" />
<div class="image_description" style="text-align: center;"><em>Little swordsmen in the flow of their training.</em></div>
Of course, all over the temple grounds, you can buy water and snacks (oh almost forgot, there is beer too!). The tourism in this area is slowly developing, but it is still off the radar for most foreigners for now. One local at the water stall offered us to show a viewpoint for 30 USD.

We politely declined as we knew that we are clever enough to find it on our own. There is one pathway at which you will see a small passage through the bush, that leads to a ladder. Climb up the ladder, and your resourcefulness will be rewarded with an amazing 360-degree view of the whole area around the hill.

You will see the green paddies, jungle going down to them, the mountains in the distance, and numerous hamlets scattered around the area. <img class="size-large wp-image-5950 aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.battambang-hill.jpg" alt="The reward on the top!" width="1024" height="684" />
<div class="image_description" style="text-align: center;"><em>The reward on the top!</em></div>
Behind, you can see the golden Wat Sampeau stupa that was created in 1964. Below it is an overgrown canyon that actually goes 144 meters deep, to an intricate cave system. <img class="size-large wp-image-5951 aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.wat-sampeau-canyon.jpg" alt="The golden stupa and the canyon beneath it." width="1024" height="685" />
<div class="image_description" style="text-align: center;"><em>The golden stupa and the canyon beneath it.</em></div>
It should be almost dusk till now, time for a special natural spectacle!
<h2><strong>The Bat Caves</strong></h2>
<img class="wp-image-5952 size-large aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/post_image.bat-cave.jpg" alt="Bats ready for the hunt, bursting out from the Bat Caves." width="1024" height="685" />
<div class="image_description" style="text-align: center;"><em>Bats ready for the hunt, bursting out of the Bat Caves.</em></div>
Of course, your visit to Phnom Sampeau won't be complete if you don't witness this natural spectacle with your own eyes! Return to the village located at the bottom of the hill, and wait for the dust to settle in.

It is usually <strong>around 5.30 PM</strong>. Then, you will see what we are talking about! Millions of bats will burst out of the huge cave, overflowing the sky for 30 minutes, and setting their sights for the hunt in Battambang.

It is really a mesmerizing sight to witness, to say at least. The laws of nature are at its flow just in front of you. Lots of people start gathering here a bit before this spectacle. You will notice metal tables and small plastic chairs set up for people to enjoy the sight. Of course, beer will be handy too!

<hr />

Phnom Sampeau is just a short drive from Battambang, and it offers much to discover. First of all, you can get a grim history lesson at the Killing Caves of Battambang, explore the numerous caves, enjoy the viewpoints, discover the golden temple; and to top it all off, witness a unique natural spectacle at the Bat Caves.

If you enjoy hiking and nature, visiting Phnom Sampeau while you are in Battambang is a no-brainer. Even if that is not the case, it is an adventure fit for a day trip from Battambang!]]></Content>

		<Content><![CDATA[Just explored Siem Reap, whether it is the renowned Angkor Wat temple complex, or just the amazing city itself? Battambang is the best destination to hit next on the road! So, how do you get from Siem Reap to Battambang?

Well, there are numerous (and cheap!) ways to get from Siem Reap to Battambang, or reverse! From your usual bus or taxi ride to a unique ferry ride on Tonle Sap, we will detail all the transport means on this relation. And last but not least, we will also share our experience of riding from Siem Reap to Battambang with a motorbike!

Without further ado, let's begin with some specifics on this route!
<h2><strong>Getting from Siem Reap to Battambang</strong></h2>
The distance between Siem Reap and Battambang is <strong>around 165 km</strong>. We researched several transport options that you can take from Siem Reap to Battambang or reverse. First, we have a bus. It is definitely the most convenient option, as it is cheap (<strong>around 8 USD for a one-way ticket</strong>), and the journey takes between 3 to 4 hours.

Then, we have the taxi. Well, it is certainly a more comfortable and faster experience than the bus and it is ideal if you are traveling in a group. Expect to pay <strong>around 50 USD for a one-way trip</strong> and to travel around two to two and a half hours.

If you opt for a more unique journey from Siem Reap to Battambang or reverse, don't hesitate to book a ferry! The ferry will provide a unique experience, as you will discover another side to the local lifestyle of Cambodia.

Just keep in mind that the ferry ride won't be really comfortable and that it will take a while. The ferry trip takes between six to eight hours and <strong>costs 25 USD</strong>. Well, without further ado, let's dive into the different possibilities of getting from Siem Reap to Cambodia (or reverse).
<h2><strong>Buses from Siem Reap to Battambang (or reverse)</strong></h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-5998" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.mekong-express-bus.jpg" alt="Mekong Express bus." width="1024" height="768" /> We have two types of buses operating from Siem Reap to Battambang, the regular and VIP buses (buses and minibusses). The regular buses usually cost around 4 USD. They are 50-seater buses and can be quite uncomfortable, especially if you are very tall.

Their <strong>journey time is around 4 hours</strong>, with toilet and snack break included. For more information on regular buses operating from Siem Reap to Battambang, check local bus stations or with your accommodation for tickets and timetables.

VIP buses (or minibusses) are <strong>quicker than regular buses</strong> as they don't stop that often. If you really need a toilet break, you can ask the driver to stop and take a short break. Their price is from 6 USD to 8 USD. Also, VIP buses are 18-seated or 25-seated.
<div class="single_post_info_box"><i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle fa-2x"></i> Most bus companies operating from Siem Reap to Battambang (or reverse) will advertise Wi-Fi on their buses. In most cases, the connection is very slow, so you will be better off with mobile data instead!</div>
If you take a bus, it is a bit longer journey, as all buses will pass via Sisophon, so that makes the journey distance of 211 km. Let's go into more detail about your options when it comes to buses and minibusses on this relation!

<strong>Regular Bus</strong> Take care, as there are quite a few shady bus companies that ride on this route. We highly recommend you to <strong>book Mekong Express or Capitol Tours</strong> if you opt for a bus journey.

Let's talk a bit about Capitol Tours, as we will detail Mekong Express in the <em>Minibus</em> section. Yes, they have regular and VIP buses! Capitol Tours, with its 42-seater buses, has quite a positive reputation in the public transport market. The journey with this company will take around three hours, and the <strong>ticket price is 5,50 USD</strong>.

One big disadvantage with Capitol Tours is that you cannot book their tickets online, so you will need to go directly to their office to book the tickets. Check out the links below if you are interested in the location of the offices, both in Siem Reap and Battambang. <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Capitol+Tours/@13.3536033,103.8540089,18z/data=!4m7!3m6!1s0x311017650b7850eb:0x104916b3c218acfa!8m2!3d13.3538447!4d103.8538405!9m1!1b1"><strong><em>The location of the Capitol Tours office in Siem Reap</em></strong></a> <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Capitol+Bus+Stop/@13.1048673,103.1971058,18.5z/data=!4m13!1m7!3m6!1s0x310549f4d348c265:0x4c9a7a3219dfb282!2sCapitol+Bus+Stop!3b1!8m2!3d13.1051238!4d103.1969471!3m4!1s0x310549f4d348c265:0x4c9a7a3219dfb282!8m2!3d13.1051238!4d103.1969471"><strong><em>The location of the Capitol Tours office in Battambang</em></strong></a>

Also, their offices aren't exactly near the bus terminals, but thankfully, Capitol Tours has you covered with their <strong>free minibus service to the terminals!</strong> Last but not least, here is the schedule of the Capitol Tours buses:
<table class="capitol_tours_schedule">
<tbody>
<tr>
<th>Route</th>
<th>Departure Times</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Siem Reap to Battambang</td>
<td>7.30 AM, 8.30 AM, 9.30 AM, 1.30 PM</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Battambang to Siem Reap</td>
<td>7.45 AM, 9.45 AM, 1 PM, 3 PM</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<strong>Minibus</strong> If you want to take a minibus on this relation, then Mekong Express is your go-to company! They are a favorite among travelers as they have a very reliable safety record. Mekong Express runs two buses every day in both directions at 8 AM and 2 PM. They have 18-seated buses and 25 seated buses.

25-seated buses depart at 8 AM from Siem Reap and at 2 PM from Battambang while 18-seated buses depart at all other times (check the Mekong Express bus schedule below to get a better understanding of this).
<div class="single_post_info_box"><i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle fa-2x"></i> Other than minibusses, Mekong Express operates regular, 40-seated buses too!</div>
The Mekong Express buses depart in the Siem Reap center, just beside the KFC near the hospital. Their buses arrive in the center of Battambang, near the Psar Nat supermarket. Foreigners can expect to pay <strong>around 7 USD for a one-way ticket</strong> on this relation. Also, you can book Mekong Express tickets online <a href="https://bookmebus.com/en/search/bus/siem-reap/battambang"><strong>here!</strong></a>

With Mekong Express, you get a great balance of price and speed, as the trip takes any time <strong>between three to four hours</strong>. Currently, the roads are pretty rough, especially on the second half of the route to Battambang, as there are roadworks about. For the end, here is the schedule of the Mekong Express buses:
<table class="mekong_express_schedule">
<tbody>
<tr>
<th>Route</th>
<th>Departure Times</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Siem Reap to Battambang</td>
<td>8 AM, 9 AM, 1.35 PM, 2 PM, 3 PM</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Battambang to Siem Reap</td>
<td>8 AM, 9 AM, 1.35 PM, 2 PM, 3 PM</td>

<h2><strong>Taxi from Siem Reap to Battambang (or reverse)</strong></h2>
<img class="size-full wp-image-5999 aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.taxi-to-battambang.jpg" alt="Taxi from Siem Reap to Battambang." width="850" height="567" /> The taxi on this relation is the best option if you want a comfortable ride to Battambang or reverse, with some nice scenery on the route. It is probably the <strong>best option if you are traveling in a group</strong>. The taxi vehicle that drives in this direction is usually Toyota Camry, which can fit 4 passengers. We suggest that you travel with less luggage if you are in a group of 3+ people, as the car trunk will be filled most of the time.

On the road, you can stop for a toilet or coffee break, and even go sightseeing if you agree with your driver. The journey on this relation with taxi <strong>costs around 50 USD</strong>. Make sure to agree on the price and on the location where you want to be dropped off before the ride itself! Where can you hire a taxi for this relation?

First of all, you can check around your accommodation, or ask a travel agent. The most convenient way is to book a taxi online via <a href="https://bookmebus.com/search/private_taxi/siem-reap/battambang"><strong>BookMeBus</strong></a>, or <a href="https://www.camboticket.com/taxi-tickets/siem-reap/battambang"><strong>Camboticket</strong></a>. When you book via BookMeBus, you can book a van which is the most comfortable taxi ride you can get on this relation. It <strong>costs 90 USD</strong>, and you will essentially get into a van with 11 seats.

If you book online via Camboticket, you can <strong>hire a taxi for 55 USD</strong>, which is also a bit more comfortable than your usual Toyota Camry taxi. The taxi ride from Siem Reap to Battambang (or reverse) will take <strong>around two to two and a half hours</strong>, depending on the road conditions, weather conditions, traffic, and how many breaks you take. One thing is certain - you can expect a very comfortable ride!
<h2><strong>Boat from Siem Reap to Battambang (or reverse)</strong></h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-6000" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.siem-reap-ferry.jpg" alt="Ferry from Siem Reap." width="1024" height="683" /> You can take a ferry from Siem Reap to Battambang or reverse, with boats departing as early as 7.30 AM. For specific departure times, check with your accommodation to get a better insight. The boat journey will take you any time <strong>between six to eight hours</strong>. That depends on the water levels and on the weather season.

You see, during the dry season (between April and June), the water levels in Tonle Sap lake are too low for a ferry ride. The best time to take a boat ride on this relation is during the wet season (from July to March), as the water levels in Tonle Sap will be enough for a boat ride. Why should you take a ferry from Siem Reap to Battambang?

Well, for starters, this is a nice way of getting to Battambang or reverse if you really want to get a feel of local culture. You will sail on Tonle Sap, which means through many floating fishing villages. This could result in a very distinct experience in this region. Keep in mind that the <strong>boats aren't the safest transportation option!</strong>

All the ferries that take this route are local-made, wooden boats, that aren't the most comfortable. It tends to be quite hot and you can hear the engine of the boat at all times. If you can sit through all that, you will be rewarded with an off the beaten track route without tourist crowds. We can't stress this enough, but if you want to avoid getting sunburned, make sure to bring sunscreen!

With that, you should take some rain protection gear, as it tends to rain often in this part of Cambodia. You can buy raincoats for 2,000 Cambodian Riel (around 0,50 USD) at almost any small streetside shop. The boat tickets <strong>cost 25 USD</strong> in either direction for one person. You can book tickets on the same day of the journey at the port. At some rare occasions, you can book a ferry ticket online <a href="https://bookmebus.com/en/search/ferry/siem-reap/battambang"><strong>here.</strong> </a>
<div class="single_post_info_box"><i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle fa-2x"></i> If you want an elite experience, it is possible to book the whole boat for 180 USD!</div>
The ferry from Siem Reap departs from Phnom Krom Port. To get there, hop on a tik-tuk for around 5 USD that can take you directly to Phnom Krom! What to say else other than to enjoy the ferry ride on the majestic Tonle Sap!
<h2><strong>Siem Reap to Battambang with Motorbike</strong></h2>
Last but not least, we want to share with you our experience of the route from Siem Reap to Battambang, which we conquered with motorbikes. To be more specific, 3 Yamaha automatic bikes, and one Honda Wave - with tons of luggage on every bike.

The journey <strong>took us 5 hours</strong>, with lots of breaks in between, changing from early afternoon, to the darkness of the night.

<em>Here is the route that we took:</em> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-5984" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.siem-reap-to-battambang-motorbike-route.jpg" alt="Siem Reap to Battambang Motorbike Route" width="1024" height="657" /> On the first half of the route, we are following Route 6 from Siem Reap to Sisophon, where we connect to the harrowing Route 5 and continue on to Battambang.

There is a 104 km distance from Siem Reap to Sisophon and 69 km distance from Sisophon to Battambang. The beginning section of Route 6 after leaving Siem Reap is full of potholes, and loads of trucks and cars that force you to hug the far right side of the road.

As we traveled around Cambodia during the wet season, we were met with lots of sunshine and lots of random showers that force you to put on the raincoats and ride further. <img class="size-large wp-image-5986" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.road-from-siem-reap.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="685" />

<div class="image_description"><em>Slapped by the remains of the rain from the truck!</em></div>
There are some amazing curvy sections on Route 6 with amazing scenery. Mostly, you will see green paddies, limestone hills, and pagodas in the distance. <img class="size-large wp-image-5988" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.amazing-scenery-cambodian-roads.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="685" />

<div class="image_description"><em>Lone palm trees in the wide stretch of green fields.</em></div>
Further down Route 6, Antonio had problems with his exhaust on Honda Wave. We were lucky to find a mechanic besides the road who fixed this problem for the short term period. It was a lovely, friendly bunch for sure! <img class="size-large wp-image-5992" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.mechanic-shop-cambodia.jpg" alt="Mechanic and his apprentices." width="1024" height="685" />
<div class="image_description"><em>Mechanic and his apprentices.</em></div>
After fixing the exhaust on the Honda Wave, we blazed through the villages to Sisophon. Then, we hit the harrowing Route 5 to Battambang, unaware of the road works that awaited us further down the road.

This road was crazy at the time of the ride. Unpaved? Check. Road holes? Check. Massively aggressive truck drivers? Check. Everything was down on the board, and we continued through this chaos. We had a lot of near-misses with the trucks, as the driveable unpaved section of the road was very narrow for both bikes and trucks together on one lane.

Also, lots of dust was produced by speedy truck drivers, and the visibility was poor. <img class="size-large wp-image-5994" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.unpaved-road-to-battambang.jpg" alt="The Route 5 in all its dusty glory." width="1024" height="685" />
<div class="image_description"><em>Route 5 in all its dusty glory.</em></div>
At one point, David got stung by a wasp in the arm, which forced us to take a small break near the sticky rice (called Kralan in Cambodia) stall. Kralan is a delicious snack served in bamboo sticks that is prevalent around Southeast Asia. <img class="size-large wp-image-5993" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.sticky-rice-kralan-stall.jpg" alt="Sticky rice snacks got our smiles up!" width="1024" height="685" />
<div class="image_description"><em>Sticky rice snacks got our smiles up!</em></div>
After devouring a few Kralan portions, the nighttime came with its challenges. During the nighttime, the visibility falters, as it is really rare to see light other than our bike headlights and an occasional truck driver.

After riding for a while, we finally got to Battambang. It was an exhilarating and challenging ride to be certain! We love rewarding rides like these!

This is what makes us so in love with motorbike trips around this amazing part of our world. <em>If you want to see how this journey looks like in motion, here is a video that we recorded on this route!</em> <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mqjWv_tgTq4&amp;t" width="764" height="430" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>

<hr />

Now that you know how to get from Siem Reap to Battambang (or reverse), we invite you to explore these two amazing locales. Of course, Siem Reap is world-famous for the Angkor Wat temple complex, but there is a certain charm to the city itself. And not to forget, the ride to Tonle Sap lake is absolutely breathtaking, and you definitely shouldn't miss that! Battambang is a more tranquil place than Siem Reap and a very vibey city.

Here is a <a href="https://vietnamchronicles.com/killing-caves-battambang"><strong>day trip from Battambang</strong> </a>that you shouldn't miss while being there! We wish you a happy journey and hope you found all the required information in this post!

		<Content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Vietnam is an extremely stunning country with so many diversity in culture, traditions, and landscape. Once you start your exploration around Vietnam, changing the places and constantly moving to other places will present you so many differences. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You can dip down in culture and tradition by visiting Hanoi, or <strong><a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/halong-bay-vietnam">wander around stunning Halong Bay</a></strong>, or explore breathtaking ancient capital of Hue, or simply chill on the long sandy coast. The options are countless!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In recent years, Vietnam became very attractive to international tourists and many places are going through rapid development. The economy started to adjust to tourism and investors reap the benefits, while locals get the tiny pieces from the pie.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">During our travels, we talked with a dozen travelers around the world and we could say it’s really <strong>not unusual to hear about scams and traps around Vietnam</strong>.

It’s always a good thing to be prepared and know how to deal with the situation.</span>
<div class="single_post_info_box">

<em><span style="font-weight: 400;">So here you go! Here’s the list of 36 most common scams in Vietnam:</span></em>

<h2><b>#1 Renting a Motorbike From a Local </b></h2>
<div class="image_description"><img class="wp-image-3435 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.renting-locals.jpg" alt="Renting motorbike from locals" width="4608" height="3456" /> <em>Be careful when renting a motorbike from a local person who doesn't own a rental service shop. If you know the person for a while, and you built trust, then it's a different story. There were many scams when people meet a local who became their instant friend. Be careful!</em></div>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Travelers who want to avoid the hustle of buying and <strong><a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/sell-motorbike-vietnam">selling their motorbike</a></strong> can rent a bike for an affordable price. The rental companies are very flexible in terms of timing and place of renting/dropping off the bike. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The very common scam, especially in smaller touristic places, is when you meet a local person, share some stories with them, you became an instant best friends and they offer you to rent their motorbike for a crazy cheap price. We know, many people think <em>“Oh, this guy is so friendly and kind, so why not help him?”! </em></span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t matter how much friendliness is around the person, this one is a very common scam in Vietnam. People will rent you their bike and you will <strong>most likely experience a breakdown after which they will ask you for a huge amount of money to repair the bike</strong>. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, we talked with a traveler in Mui Ne who has got scammed by local guy renting his bike. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>The story went like this...</em> </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The guy rented a bike from a local person, parked the bike in front of the pub and when he came back from the pub he couldn't find a bike. The local demanded <strong>around 10 million VND to settle the bill</strong>. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">What happened with the bike? Probably the local had two set of keys, followed the traveler and just drove with his bike while claiming the money for the <em>‘stolen’</em> bike. </span>

<em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pretty creative, huh?</span></em>
<div class="single_post_info_box">

<i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle fa-2x"></i> When renting a motorbike, always check the company name on the internet. If the rental company is reliable, they will usually have a Facebook page with many stories, pictures, and reviews.

<em><strong>Read the reviews from travelers and connect with them so you can talk about their experience with the bike and the rental service.</strong></em>

Never rent a bike from a local person or the company without the presence. That way, you will avoid many headaches and you can really focus on experiencing all the beauty Vietnam has to offer.

<h2><b>#2 Photographers Around Touristic Places</b></h2>
<div class="image_description"><img class="wp-image-3436 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.photographers.jpg" alt="Photographers at Hai Van" width="932" height="603" /> <em>Local photographers usually walk around the touristic places and offer the tourist a photo session. It's less of the scam, but more the naivety or ignorance of tourists that the photo session would be free. Do you get a free photo session in your country?</em></div>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This one is very common everywhere in Vietnam where the tourism is existent. There will be the <strong>woman carrying fruits on their shoulders or wearing traditional clothes</strong> offering you to take it for the purpose of taking the photo.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You get the clothes and fruits, take a photo that will give you many likes on social media, but soon after, they will ask you for the compensation!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, on the beaches around Vietnam, there are usually few people with the cameras asking people to take the photos in different poses. After a photo session, they will follow you and ask you for the money. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This one is very crazy as they won’t let you alone for some time and they are literally killing the vibe. Just don’t fall on this one!</span>
<div class="single_post_info_box">

<i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle fa-2x"></i> When someone is offering you their stuff just to take a photo or offering you a photo session as a friend, you should just say a friendly no.

People will usually understand and they will move away from you in order to find another ‘customer’.

</div>

<h2><b>#3 Switching the Bills</b></h2>
<div class="image_description"><img class="wp-image-3484 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.switching-money.jpg" alt="Switching money" width="866" height="647" /> <em>Always pay attention to banknotes since some are very similar, especially 20 and 500 thousand Vietnam Dong.</em></div>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Switching the bills is an easily avoidable scam, but you must be very cautious, especially in busy tourist places. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, every Vietnamese banknote has Ho Chi Minh’s face on one side while some even have the same color which makes it easy to mistake the note. The biggest bill of 500k and 20k are both <strong>blue color (a bit different gradient)</strong> and it can be easy for people to pull the scam.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If something costs 20k and you don’t have a smaller bill, so you pay with 500k, people can just take the money and try to act like they didn’t notice the bill. Sometimes it works in very busy places and people are losing the money on that.</span>
<div class="single_post_info_box"><i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle fa-2x"></i> Always break your money in smaller banknotes so you can pay the exact price without worrying about the change.</div>

<hr />

<h2><b>#4 Shoe Repairs</b></h2>
<div class="image_description"><img class="wp-image-3437 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.shoe-repair.jpg" alt="Shoe repair lady waiting for customers" width="829" height="618" /> <em>Always be attentive, especially in big cities around touristic attractions. Don't let anyone apply anything on your shoes. Just say a friendly no and walk away from shoe repair guys.</em></div>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This one is common in big cities, especially around the Old District in Hanoi. There are many shoe repair guys sitting on the street and following foreigners in order to pull the scam. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When you walk around Old District, it’s a chaotic place with many things happening at once, so it’s very hard to be focused on everything. That’s when these shoe repair guys get in, jump on your shoes and apply the glue.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Afterward, the guy will take a thread from your shoes and try to sell you the story that you need a repair. The guy usually o<strong>ffers the repair for a $1</strong> and that’s when many people agree!</span>
<blockquote><em><strong>The thing is that the guy doesn’t apply the glue, but the liquid that dissolves stitches on your shoes. The liquid instantly makes the condition of your shoes worse and many people think why not.</strong></em></blockquote>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">When the guy finishes the job he will ask for <strong>10 - 20x more than agreed</strong> and he will follow you all around until you settle for the price. It’s a huge headache and you don’t want to fall on this one.</span>
<div class="single_post_info_box"><i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle fa-2x"></i> Simply say no when you notice shoe repair guys and never let anyone do anything with your shoes or any other fabric on you.</div>

<hr />

<h2><b>#5 Massage Seduction</b></h2>
<div class="image_description"><img class="wp-image-3438 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.massage-vietnam.jpg" alt="Massage ladies waiting for customers" width="929" height="619" /> <em>Don't get the massage from the 'street'. Always look for a reputable massage shop with professional staff.</em></div>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>After many kilometers on the road, your body will feel very sore, so why not to take a good and cheap massage to recover your body?</em> </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It seems like there shouldn’t be a question about taking the massage, especially when you see a hot woman in front of the massage shop offering the massage. </span>

<em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Who would say no?</span></em>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This one is a very prevalent scam not only in Vietnam but around SEAN countries. So, what is the scam?</span>
<blockquote><strong><em>Basically, the beautiful woman will stay in front of the shop and seducing tourists to get inside the massage room. Many people think they will get the massage by the woman they are talking in front, so they started to fantasize about different possible endings.</em> </strong></blockquote>
<em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Believe us, none of these endings will happen!</span></em>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The next thing that will happen is that the beautiful lady will lead you to massage room, show you the entrance and tell you to wait. In a minute, you will be in the room with a totally different person who isn’t that hot and also, not a professional masseur. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Expect to pay a big price for the massage you get.</span>
<div class="single_post_info_box"><i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle fa-2x"></i> Always read the reviews of massage places before going and check out the prices. If the massage place is reputable and has good reviews, even if it costs a bit more, just go for it since traveling around the country can exhaust your body!</div>

<h2><b>#6 Motorbike Taxi Drivers</b></h2>
<div class="image_description"><img class="wp-image-3439 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.motorbike-taxi.jpg" alt="Motorbike taxi on the street" width="854" height="583" /> <em>Skip motorbike taxi drivers from the street and book a Grab driver instead.</em></div>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This scam is very common in big cities as there are many tourists and even more motorbikes in the traffic. There are many official apps for taking a motorbike taxi, but sometimes, the person just approaches you and you think why not to take a ride with this friendly guy.</span>

Be careful with motorbike taxis around small places since it's probably one of the only ways to do the transportation around. We traveled to <a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/phan-rang-kitesurfing">Phan Rang to do some amazing kitesurfing</a> and it's very prevalent to use motorbike taxi there!

<span style="font-weight: 400;">These fake motorbike taxi drivers <strong>will drive you and drop you off in the middle of nowhere asking for the crazy amount of money</strong>. If you disagree pay they will extort money from you with the help of the friends.</span>
<div class="single_post_info_box">

<i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle fa-2x"></i> Always use official taxi carrier or <strong><a href="https://www.grab.com/vn/en/">Grab</a></strong>. That way, you get the price in front, so you know how much you’re supposed to pay for the service.

Sometimes, if there is no another option, you can take the motorbike taxi, but always agree on the price in front and don't forget to have a GPS on!

<h2><b>#7 Let’s Drive Around the City</b></h2>
<div class="image_description"><img class="wp-image-3440 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.taxi-around.jpg" alt="Inside a taxi car" width="823" height="614" /> <em>Always be aware of the route and a distance to your destination when taking a taxi since many taxi drivers will do a detour to your destination in order to earn more money.</em></div>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">People usually experience scams when it comes to taxi drivers. There are few popular scams taxi drivers pull on travelers, and one of the most common is just <strong>driving the longest distance to the destination</strong>. </span>

<em><span style="font-weight: 400;">It works like this...</span></em>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You get in the taxi, confirm the destination and the neverending ride starts. The next thing you notice that your ride is longer than expected, even if your destination is just around the corner. The driver will give you the excuses including construction works or traffic jams around. Once the drive is over, the driver will ask for a few times higher price than agreed on the beginning.</span>
<div class="single_post_info_box">

<i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle fa-2x"></i> Always check the fastest route to your destination and have it on your phone running when driving by taxi. Never agree to sit down in a taxi without taximeter on.

If you notice that driver is taking another route, <strong>show him your map and demand the route on your map</strong>. If the driver doesn’t agree, just tell him to stop the car and pay an amount on a taximeter.

Use Grab in the cities. It’s so much cheaper, flexible and you can check the price in the application.

<h2><b>#8 Luggage Bus Fees</b></h2>
<div class="image_description"><img class="wp-image-3441 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.luggage-bus.jpg" alt="Bus station in Saigon" width="931" height="618" /> <em>Luggage is usually free while using public transportation in Vietnam, but be sure to confirm the fares while buying the ticket since the policies differ from company to company.</em></div>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Many times, the bus drivers will try to get more money from travelers because of their ignorance. This one is one of the most common scams when it comes to public transportation.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When you buy a ticket, the <strong>luggage fee is included and you shouldn’t pay anything extra</strong> except if you’re putting a motorbike or any bigger things as luggage. Some bus drivers will require you to pay extra for your bags as they will claim you have too much luggage.</span>

&nbsp;
<div class="single_post_info_box">

<i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle fa-2x"></i> The scam is total nonsense and they are trying to get the money from travelers because they are not familiar with the rules. Once you pay for the ticket you can put your luggage in the bus free of additional costs.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Always ask and <strong>confirm the quantity and size of the luggage that's included in the bus ticket price</strong>. The luggage policies differ from company to company. </span>

<h2><b>#9 Cyclo Rides in Hoi An</b></h2>
<div class="image_description"><img class="wp-image-3442 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.cyclo-driver.jpg" alt="Cyclo drivers in Hoi An" width="1048" height="611" /> <em>Cyclo ride can be an amazing way to explore the city or a town, but before jumping into one, be sure to agree on the price.</em></div>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Cyclos are three wheel bicycles that you can see around Vietnam, but the most common destination for cyclos is definitely the ancient town Hoi An. Once you put your foot in the ancient city, you will see many cyclo drivers driving tourists and asking people to jump in for the memorable drive around Hoi An.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you make an eye-contact with the driver, they will offer you a drive around the town. Usually, <strong>drivers claim the ride is free or you decide how much you'd like to pay after a ride</strong>. </span>

<em><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s the biggest red flag in SEA!</span></em>
<blockquote><em><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Drivers will show you their book of recommendations and reviews from the travelers, but it’s often written by themselves in many different languages. Many travelers fall on that, so they just jump in the ride.</strong> </span></em></blockquote>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes, the ride can take the whole day while drivers are building trust with the customers. At the end of the trip, they will drop you off in a secluded area and demand a crazy amount of money for the ride. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a very uncomfortable experience that can have many unpleasant endings, so it’s better to know how to deal with it.</span>

&nbsp;
<div class="single_post_info_box">

<i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle fa-2x"></i> If you really want to experience a cyclo ride around stunning places, the best way is to agree on the price in front. Also, don’t forget to agree on the drop off place that is familiar to you since you don’t want to end up in a dark alley with a driver.

<em><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Always have a GPS opened, so you can be aware where are you at every moment.</strong> </span></em>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A good practice in touristic places is to always have your valuables stored in a <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B010U13F50/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=calisequipzon-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B010U13F50&amp;linkId=6aa82ed96577fc1237f73bafac5a2c9a">money belt</a></strong> or hidden bag. The good practice is also having a spare wallet where you have a smaller amount of money. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">That way, you can claim it is all you have so there is no point in trying to get more than you have. Drivers will usually accept that!</span>

<h2><b>#10 Fake Travel Agents and Companies</b></h2>
<div class="image_description"><img class="wp-image-3443 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.sinh-cafe-scam.jpg" alt="Sinh Cafe fake" width="1023" height="329" /> <em>When booking a tour, always use official platforms like Klook and read many reviews from other customers.</em></div>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Vietnam is becoming a booming tourist market since the whole country offers such a diverse culture combined with breathtaking landscape and a long coast with stunning sandy beaches. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The country became a dream destination to many travelers, and there are many tour companies that are getting recognized around the country for their extraordinary services. Once tourists recognize the company's services, <strong>many copycats with similar names start popping up like mushrooms.</strong></span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Usually, fake travel companies are using the same names with minor changes, so if you’re not careful, you can end up scammed thinking you’re organizing a trip with a reputable company. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, the most known scam comes into mind when we talk about <strong>Sinh Cafes</strong>. The real company is called <strong><a href="https://www.thesinhtourist.vn/">Sinh Tourist</a></strong> and they offer an amazing tourist service for an affordable price.</span>

<strong>Further reading: <a href="https://www.thesinhtourist.vn/fraudwarning">The list of fake Sinh Cafes in Hanoi</a>.</strong>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many <strong>copycats called Sinh Cafe Travel, Sinh Cafe Tours, etc</strong>. Literally, there are thousand different, but similar names that can easily misguide people. Be aware when booking tours in Vietnam and always do your research before!</span>

&nbsp;
<div class="single_post_info_box">

<i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle fa-2x"></i> The scam isn’t only around tour companies but can be found around hotel and restaurant businesses as well. Be aware when booking anything in Vietnam related to tourism and always <strong>use reliable and recognized booking platforms</strong>.

<em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking to book an organized tour around Vietnam?</span></em>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We suggest you check legitimate websites that offer the listing of only reputable companies offering organized tours. The most popular website for tours in Asia is <strong><a href="https://www.klook.com">Klook</a></strong>, so check it out!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For the accommodation, always use the platforms like <strong><a href="https://www.agoda.com">Agoda</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://www.booking.com">Booking</a> </strong>or<strong> <a href="https://airbnb.com">Airbnb</a></strong>. These platforms have the criteria for accepting the hosts which give you a certain sense of security. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Always read reviews of other travelers and check the pictures to get a clear idea of the place you’re going to stay in.</span>

<h2><b>#11 Fruit Sellers</b></h2>
<div class="image_description"><img class="wp-image-3444 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.fruit-seller.jpg" alt="Fruit sellers at the beach" width="4608" height="3456" /> <em>Fruit sellers will usually sell you the fresh fruits at the inflated price. You should always know the price of the goods you're buying so you can bargain. Expect to pay a bit more than on a market, but keep in mind that it helps these local people and that's the way they put the food on the table.</em></div>
<span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 16px;">We didn’t encounter this scam around the countryside and smaller towns, but in the cities, it’s a common scam, especially around touristic places. For instance, around Kiem lake in Hanoi, you will experience the scam almost every minute, so it’s wise to know how to deal with it.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Fruit sellers are usually older woman carrying some fruits on their shoulders and targeting tourists. They will follow you and ask you to buy the fruits at a crazy price. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A woman around Kiem lake offered us half of the pineapple for 50k VND. For example, at that time, the whole pineapple at the market didn’t cost more than 15k VND. We knew the reasonable price and we told the lady 20k VND and she acted offended, so we just walked away and at the end, she settled for 20k VND.</span>

<em><strong>Note: </strong>Don't get an impression we're spoiled tourists who don't support local communities. Far from that! We always try to give back, eat and buy at local stores and markets. We're not ignorant and we always do the research before traveling in any country. These sellers get the fruits at a much cheaper price at the market than tourists, so selling the same for 5 - 10x higher price isn't acceptable for us. </em>

&nbsp;
<div class="single_post_info_box">

<i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle fa-2x"></i> Sellers will follow you, but one NO is enough as they will realize they are wasting their time since there are thousands of tourists around.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, if you really want to buy the fruits from them, it’s advisable to <strong>know the prices of the fruits before since you can bargain</strong>. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Walking away works like a charm too.</span>

<h2><b>#12 Western Restaurants </b></h2>
<div class="image_description"><img class="wp-image-3445 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.western-restaurant.jpg" alt="Restaurants in Hoi An" width="971" height="643" /> <em>Restaurants without a single local person can instantly tell you the prices are higher and the quality of the food is probably lower. For the best experience, we advise you to eat around local restaurants.</em></div>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Almost every town or city has a part which is totally targeted to tourists and expats. Be aware of these places as many scams are going on there, especially around the restaurants.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>How to say the restaurant is for westerners?</em> </span>
<blockquote><em><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Well, you won’t see a single Vietnamese person inside and also, the prices aren’t only in VND, but also in foreign currencies.</strong> </span></em></blockquote>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The prices are usually a few times higher compared to the local restaurants and street food, but it’s up to you to choose where you’re going to eat, right? </span>

<em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thinking of paying in a foreign currency? Think twice!</span></em>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"> The restaurant staff will give you a really bad exchange rate, so they won’t only rip you off on the food prices, but also on the exchange rate.</span>

&nbsp;
<div class="single_post_info_box">

<i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle fa-2x"></i> For the best food experience, just find a local spot where the locals eat. These places are filled with delicious food at a reasonable price. Always ask for the price before ordering as staff will usually charge you more than locals.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t be surprised if you don’t ask for the price to see locals are paying one price, and you’re paying totally another.</span>

Don't get offended by it since it won't make a huge difference to your wallet, but it can make a difference to locals and their families.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Always have VND with you in Vietnam since it’s an official currency and you won’t get charged by unofficial exchange rates.</span>

Be careful since people will usually put a handful of food on your table and charge you a lot for it without saying anything. Don't be ignorant and ask for the price or simply reject anything that you didn't order.</em></div>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">We mainly experience scams around bigger touristy attractions and cities, but this one never gets old, even in the most remote areas around the country! </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a huge culture of Nhau, which is basically eating delicious food, having fun with friends and drinking lots of beer. When you come to the restaurant and order beers, in some places, they will <strong>bring a bowl of peanuts, even if you didn’t order it</strong>.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s easy to think it’s included in the price, but don’t be fooled! Nothing is for free! The dozens of peanuts usually cost more than a can of a beer.</span>

&nbsp;

<h2><b>#14 Fake Clothing Brands</b></h2>

The prices are very low for the goods and believe or not, some goods have a high-quality. We bought Nort Face backpacks for about 200k VND and we're still using them.</em></div>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Vietnam has borders with China and also Vietnamese culture is hugely influenced by Chinese culture. It’s not a strange thing that the fake clothing market is booming!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When you’re buying the clothes or any other goods on the local market, it's <strong>close to 100% chance these goods are imported from China and are fake</strong>. Depending on the place, you can get very good quality and cheap goods from street vendors! Many travelers fall on this scam while <a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/souvenirs-from-vietnam"><strong>buying souvenirs in Vietnam</strong></a>, especially silk or traditional dresses like Ao Dai. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Always inspect the quality of the goods and don’t accept the first price. Learn how to bargain in Vietnam as it will save you a lot of money!</span>

&nbsp;
<div class="single_post_info_box">

<i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle fa-2x"></i> Always check the quality of the clothes in local markets. You don’t need to buy an original brand, as you can stumble across very high-quality fake goods for a funny amount of money that will serve you well.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, we bought a few <em>‘North Pole’</em> backpacks from the street vendors in Hanoi. The price was around <strong>200k VND for a 65L backpack</strong>. We used the backpacks for our trip around Vietnam through different weather conditions and these backpacks were serving and still serving us on our adventures.</span>

Just be patient with the security guy and eventually he will let you in for some compensation.</em></div>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">It's hard to understand the logic behind securing abandoned places. After visiting this park around Hue, you will get a whole different idea on creativity when it comes to scams. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So, when you arrive at the entrance of abandoned waterpark, there will be a security officer in his small house blocking the way. At first, he will be tough and won’t let you in. Then a younger guy will appear out of nowhere who will tell you that he can bring you to the park for the price. The guy asked for <strong>100k VND per person</strong> and we refused, but many travelers followed him.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">After a while, the security guy let us in for <strong>30k VND per person</strong>. Later we saw the young guy and the security guy in the security house sharing the money.</span>

&nbsp;
<div class="single_post_info_box">

<i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle fa-2x"></i> If you want to get to the park, you will probably need to pay some money to the security guard in front of the park. Also, it’s advisable to meet some locals in Hue since there is an entrance through the forest where you don’t need to pay anything.

We tried to find it but ended up lost in the forest while doing crazy offroad with our bikes. It was a great experience!

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The rate of motorbike thefts is constantly growing, especially in bigger cities. There is a huge market for stolen bikes, but they are not worth anything without the proper and matching blue card. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Thieves usually have a deal with mechanics or stores, so they <strong>sell the bikes for the parts or make the fake blue card</strong>. It’s a huge business around here, so be extra careful with your bike.</span>

&nbsp;
<div class="single_post_info_box">

<i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle fa-2x"></i> The most important thing is to have a strong lock, preferably U-Lock and park your bike in a secure place.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many parking spots around the cities where the security guards will constantly take a look at your bike. The price for the whole day of <strong>secured parking won’t be more than 10k VND</strong>.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Petty robberies are not so common in Vietnam, but there are some travelers who experienced their valuables being stolen in the middle of the day. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Basically, these kind of robberies are very common in tourist areas around big cities. Always be on your guard when walking around busy touristy streets. If you ever get robbed, then you'll probably experience it around these places. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The most usual ways of robbing are grab and run or distract and steal. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Be careful walking with your phone or checking the phone on the street since there are thefts on the bikes who are sitting at the back of the bike while grabbing valuable things from people. There is simply no way to get your stuff back once it’s in their hands. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Many people leave their valuables on the beach while swimming and it’s a perfect chance for thieves to get your valuables. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the restaurants, always take care of your bags, wallet, phones and other valuables. It’s common that people will get inside the restaurant, walk by and just grab unattended stuff around. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Stealing valuables in buses or trains are very common as well as thieves around ATMs. In the small places like Mui Ne, there are always few motorbike drivers around ATM selling cannabis. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Be careful and extra aware when withdrawing the money and don’t do it alone in the middle of the night as there is a possibility they will take advantage of you.</span>

A flock of taxi drivers who want to <em>‘help’</em> you with your transportation will suddenly hit you like a lightning strike. Sadly, most of the transportation scams are going to happen around the airports.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">People are usually very tired and jet-lagged to think clearly, so they accept any rates and don’t think about the creativity of scammers around. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, if you have a pre-arranged driver from the airport to your accommodation, there will be drivers holding the names of passengers in front of terminals. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Scammers usually walk around and copy the names of people/hotels and some people notice their name on the sign and without asking they get into the car.</strong></span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"> The driver will drive them to in the right direction and in the middle of the drive they will call a random person and share with you a sad new that the hotel you have a booking in is suddenly full. After that, the driver will drop you off to the hotel they get a commission from and also, charge you a lot for the extra drive.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Taking a bus drive to travel around the country is a very convenient and cheap way of exploring stunning Vietnam. The buses in Vietnam are fairly comfortable since the majority of them are sleeper buses. You can lie down while traveling, and even sleep through the night which saves you some extra money on the accommodation. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The only problem is that sometimes, the buses will just drop you off in the middle of nowhere. The interesting thing is that there are countless taxi drivers in the middle of nowhere, so they will offer you crazy fares for the rides as they know you don’t have the option or energy to think or do anything else.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Fake taxi companies are popping up like mushrooms after the rain. Once one company gets big, there are many fake companies with similar names offering sketchy and overpriced services to people who think they are using the official services. </span>
<blockquote><strong><em>Fake taxi drivers can be mainly found around airports, train stations and big tourist attractions. When they see foreigners they are usually the first ones to appear in front of you to take your luggage and sit you in their car.</em></strong></blockquote>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The most reputable taxi companies in Vietnam are <a href="http://www.vinasuntaxi.com/"><strong>Vinasun</strong></a> and <a href="https://www.mailinh.vn/"><strong>Mai Linh</strong></a>, but fake taxi drivers are very smart, so they copy the design of their cars to look almost identical as the cars from the real companies. The only difference is in small details.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, the name of the company is slightly different so it’s not unusual to see Vinnasun or Vinasum driving around. It’s so hard to notice that, especially after a long flight.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, they have different phone numbers or even fake taxi driver cards on them. </span>

<em><strong>How to recognize a fake taxi company?</strong></em>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Buying a working SIM card in Vietnam is literally effortless. There are countless places that offer a valid SIM card with a number and super-fast internet data. You don’t even need to provide any personal information when you’re buying a new SIM card.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The store buys many SIM cards for a cheap price and sells it to people for a higher price. The only problem is that once the store buys it from an official store, the package plan already started which means days of usage are counting. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many cases where tourists bought SIM cards from a reseller <strong>claiming the card comes with X days of unlimited 4G internet</strong>. Later, the buyer found out the card stopped to work after just a few days of usage.</span>

<blockquote><em><strong>These drivers usually work with the police for the commission. They sell you cannabis and contact a dirty cop.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, we were eating chicken rice in Saigon and saw locals paying 30k VND for a bowl. We blindly believed we will be charged the same, but after some bargaining, we paid 60k VND. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">People know it won’t hurt you so much, but it can help them and their families, especially if you’re a tourist who is just exploring the place for a few days.</span>

&nbsp;
<div class="single_post_info_box">

<i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle fa-2x"></i> This one is the easiest to avoid - just ask the price in front. Once you have a price deal in Vietnam, people usually respect that and you can expect to pay that price.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It doesn’t cost you anything to ask for the price, but it can save you a lot of time and money. It’s a hard habit to do it always, but many places don’t have menu presented, so the only way not to get ripped off is to ask for the price in front.</span>

<h2><b>#27 False Train and Bus Tickets</b></h2>
<div class="image_description"><img class="wp-image-3457 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.train-tickets.jpg" alt="Train arriving to Da Nang" width="977" height="643" /> <em>Don't buy public transport tickets from resellers. Just go to the station or official website while buying a ticket and you can be sure that you have the right seat.</em></div>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The market for train and bus tickets is huge and booming since more tourists decide to explore the beauty of the country by taking public transportation. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s important to note that these tickets aren’t fake, but these are probably not suitable for the seat you’d like to book.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, there are people who buy the cheapest train or bus tickets claiming you that these tickets are exactly the ones you need. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You are able to get on the bus or train, but be ready to pay a juicy fine since the tickets are probably not valid for the seat you’re taking.</span>

&nbsp;
<div class="single_post_info_box">

<i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle fa-2x"></i> Always buy tickets directly from a transportation company or on the main stations. Some hostels/hotels offer the services, so it’s a good thing to check with your accommodation.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, don’t hesitate to ask people in your accommodation to help you with booking your ticket for public transport. </span>

<h2><b>#28 Child Street Vendors</b></h2>

We advise you to educate on the topic before you decide what to do or how to act when encountering a kid on the street offering you things.</em></div>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Street kids is a term used for kids working and often living on the street apart from their families. There are many heartbreaking stories of street kids and even more reasons how one kid ends up working on the street. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Corrupted adults see this socio-economic <em>‘trend’</em> as a business opportunity and sometimes the term <em>'street kids'</em> is closely related to organized business. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’ve ever walked around Kiem lake in Hanoi or Benh Than Market in Saigon, there is a huge possibility you stumble upon a small kid trying to sell you a thing or a service. It’s very heartbreaking to see a small kid on the street working all day to earn pennies. It’s very hard to resist not paying or giving away some money to the kid.</span>

<strong>Educate yourself: <a href="http://www.grips.ac.jp/vietnam/KOarchives/doc/EP17_DP6.pdf">Street children in Vietnam</a>.</strong>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The majority of the money will never get to the kids' pocket or a belly. Kids on the street usually work for an adult and maybe get pennies if anything from your money. Giving away your money to street kids just furtherly support these kids being on the street far away from their family and schools.</span>

&nbsp;
<div class="single_post_info_box">

<i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle fa-2x"></i> We know that it sounds harsh and maybe not moral, but don’t give away money to the street kids. Instead, support the organizations working with street kids with your money or time.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Probably the best thing you could do when encounter a street kid is to bring the kid to a restaurant and share a delicious meal together. If it’s not filling their pockets, it’s filling their bellies and hearts at least.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This scam isn’t very common among regular tourists, but as soon as you decide to do a motorbike trip around Vietnam, you become vulnerable to the scam. Young Westerners who’re hungry for the adventure in an exotic country with stunning landscape and diverse culture are mainly the ones who decide to drive a motorbike around the country. </span>

<em><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you can recognize yourself in the description above, there is one question for you. How much do you know about mechanical stuff when it comes to motorbikes?</span></em>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, based on our experience (we included), probably close to zero!</span>

<strong>Planning a motorbike trip: <a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/vietnam-on-a-budget">A detailed cost breakdown of 30 days biking around Vietnam!</a></strong>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are thousands of motorbike sellers around Vietnam, especially in Hanoi and Saigon. Travelers usually start their journey from one of these two cities, and the options are endless when it comes to buying a motorbike. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone will tell you their motorbike is the most reliable without any breakdowns. Even the backpackers who just did the trip around the country!</span>
<blockquote><em><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>The scam is most common among resellers - the people who’re buying motorbikes from desperate backpackers who’re leaving the country for pennies - who’re then doing some minor repairs and selling bikes for a higher price.</strong> </span></em></blockquote>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a very common business in big cities as the demand is growing with more tourists flocking to the country. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Basically, you will meet a guy who will tell you all the best about his motorbikes and who will act like your friend. Once the transaction is done, the guy disappears and if you’re lucky, you will drive some distance before experiencing weird sounds and behavior of the bike. Usually, your trip will end up in the garage of a local mechanic to diagnose and repair the engine.</span>

&nbsp;
<div class="single_post_info_box">

<i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle fa-2x"></i> Always take more time than planned when buying the motorbike in Vietnam as there are literally thousands of bikes available. Never rush and take your time to check as many bikes as possible!

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember that everyone is trying to sell their bike, so everyone is doing a pitch when it comes to selling. Don’t buy it and simply be sure to be knowledgeable about the motorbikes. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re newby, we wrote a huge <strong><a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/buy-motorbike-in-vietnam">list of things you should check when buying a motorbike in Vietnam</a>.</strong> It’s recommended to check these things by yourself and a company of a local friend who knows a mechanic would be of great help.</span>

Be careful since some people will expect huge compensation. Always figure that out at the beginning of your ride.</em></div>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Hitchhiking culture in Vietnam isn’t so huge, but still, people will stop their cars or motorbikes to help you. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We didn’t have a chance to hitchhike around the whole country, but only around the few touristic places. Also, we talked with few travelers who traveled around Vietnam using mainly public transportation and hitchhiking, so the experiences are mixed.</span>

<strong>Expand your knowledge: <a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/culture-shocks-in-vietnam">Culture shocks you'll most likely experience in Vietnam!</a></strong>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">While we were hitchhiking around Ninh Binh, we were probably waiting for few minutes with our sign and a friendly lady stopped offering us a ride. We were so amazed and happy, so we just hopped in the car. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Few minutes and kilometers later, she dropped us off and asked for 50k VND. It’s not a lot of money, but still, in Vietnam, that can get your belly filled for a day!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We started to hitchhike again on the road she dropped us off, and we encountered the same lady again who stopped again. This time she offered us to help us and drop us on the right road without taking any money.</span>

&nbsp;
<div class="single_post_info_box"><i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle fa-2x"></i> Just be careful when hitchhiking. You can ask for the money in front of you just get out of the car when they stop.

Don't get deceived by beautiful hostess handling you the menu. It's usually a known scam and it will cost you much more than going by yourself.</em></div>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The vibrant and lively nightlife finds its home around the busy backpacker's roads. In Hanoi, there is an Old District area while in Saigon there is a Bui Vien street. These areas are popular for drinking and partying till the morning hours. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When you walk around these areas you will stumble upon many beautiful women holding menus with <em>‘discounts’</em> on drinks and trying to get you in the bar. Many people fall on this one since they are already drunk when hostess approach them, so it’s an easy task for them.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">They will present you the menu with expensive prices but will claim that you will get a<strong> discounted price if you mention their name when ordering drinks</strong>. There is one interesting thing about this one.</span>
<blockquote><em><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>The menu they are presenting is a fake one and the ‘discounted’ price is actually a real price in the bar.</strong> </span></em></blockquote>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes, the beautiful hostess will join your table with drinks and you will get surprised when you get the bill. The reason? The bill will be filled with the drinks a hostess drank too! </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This scam is very prevalent in SEA, especially in busy touristic areas. Always be careful with this scam as you can get into real trouble with bouncers. If you start to argue about the price, before you know, you will be surrounded by many bouncers claiming that you have to pay. Believe us, you don’t want to have problems with bouncers in a foreign country!</span>

&nbsp;
<div class="single_post_info_box"><i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle fa-2x"></i> Simply say no to people offering you discounts and showing you the menus on the road. It will be always more expensive than usual and there is a huge possibility you’ll get scammed on one way or another.</div>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Police traps are not so common around the country, but there are few places known for traps and corrupt officers trying to get the money from travelers. For instance, one of the <strong>traps is in Mui Ne between Red and White sand dunes</strong>.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There is always a police blockade targeting foreigners. If you’re driving through the road between dunes, there is a high possibility you’ll get pulled over. It’s a very ridiculous situation there as they are literally stopping everyone without any reason. They ask for around <strong>2 million VND to let you go or they treat they will confiscate your bike</strong>. Many travelers got scared and pay the bribe to continue the journey.</span>

<strong>Prepare yourself: <a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/vietnamese-police-guide">How to deal with Vietnamese police?</a></strong>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have all the required documents for driving legally in Vietnam and you’re totally sure that you didn’t break the laws, then you shouldn’t worry since they won’t be able to write you a ticket.</span>

&nbsp;
<div class="single_post_info_box">

<i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle fa-2x"></i> Simply avoid the known police traps. There are few, but always there is an optional road you can take to avoid the police. Just take the other road and you’re safe!

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, before driving, it’s not a bad decision to have an<strong> IDP and Vietnamese driving license</strong> that will enable you to drive legally around the country. If you’ve got pulled over by the police and you have all the documents, they won’t hassle with you and tickets. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In that process, they usually <strong>pickpocket some money or even change notes</strong>. Just check out 500k and 20k bills, they are easily getting confused and many people are taking the advantage of it.</span>

&nbsp;
<div class="single_post_info_box">

<i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle fa-2x"></i> Never give anyone access to your wallet except you. It’s extremely rude and disrespectful when people reach to your wallet. Believe us, it will happen and it’s up to you how you protect yourself from this scam.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The best thing would be to have a spare wallet where you have enough money for daily expenses. Even if something happens, you won’t lose much money or valuable documents. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Another good thing would be an RFID blocking wallet that hides notes from others. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, when you’re walking around busy touristic areas, it’s advisable to store your valuables in anti-theft bags and put your the money in money belt since there are many scams and pickpockets around these areas.</span>

<em><span style="font-weight: 400;">We must say that this one is genious! How does this scam work?</span></em>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As we all know, Vietnam is filled with tourist attractions either natural wonders, stunning landscape or just temples. The main transportation means in Vietnam is by far motorbike, and you can’t access the touristic sites with the motorbike. You need to park your bike somewhere, right?</span>

<em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, there is a huge chance for scammers to jump in and get some money from first-time visitors!</span></em>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There is usually a parking site just in front of tourist attractions with the formal looking people telling you to park your bike there. Whenever you see it, just continue driving until you reach the attraction. You can ask for the parking at the ticket counter and usually, they will offer to park for free once you’re exploring the site. </span>
<blockquote><em><strong>The one of these scams is in front of Hang Mua Caves in Tam Coc, Ninh Binh. Also, all around this area, everyone will ask you for parking money, even if you drive a bicycle.</strong></em></blockquote>
&nbsp;
<div class="single_post_info_box">

<i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle fa-2x"></i> Always do the research before visiting any tourist attractions. Check out the parking options and you will definitely stumble upon the scams and how to avoid them in the area you’re visiting. Don’t be ignorant and always seek for the information since these scams are working on people’s ignorance.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Just don’t accept paying for the parking and drive to the ticket counter. People there will give you the right information and options for the parking. Please note that parking is usually free and provided by the place you’re visiting.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">No matter which attraction you plan to visit, there should be an official ticket counter where you pay and get an official ticket. <strong>From the scammers, you will never get a ticket!</strong></span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When eating in a restaurant, especially in ones that are targeted for tourist, be aware of this scam. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There is no tipping culture in Vietnam, so there are rare cases that someone will ever ask you for a tip. Anyway, some restaurants figure out how to play the scam on naive or ignorant travelers. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">After you get the bill and want to pay with larger notes, people won’t give you the whole change. Many people won’t even count, so it’s effortless to pull this scam. </span>

<strong>If you count your money and notice there is a mistake in the change, the staff will usually tell you it’s for the tip.</strong>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not acceptable as the tip is something the customer should leave to the staff for the good service.</span>

&nbsp;
<div class="single_post_info_box">

<i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle fa-2x"></i> Always count your money after paying the bills. Demand the whole change if something isn’t right, even if you need to talk with the supervisors.

Now you have much information about the scams and very uncomfortable situations you can put yourself in because of not having the information or not knowing the differences in the culture.

It will definitely make your trip more memorable without many negative experiences!

		<Content><![CDATA[Motorbiking the Ha Giang loop is one of the most memorable experiences you can get in Vietnam and the whole of Southeast Asia. It is located in the Ha Giang Province, the northernmost province in Vietnam that borders with China.

You will be rewarded with some of the most appealing scenery and magnificent mountain passes and vistas in Southeast Asia. Ha Giang Province features the most dramatic landscape in Vietnam without a second guess!

Roads have greatly improved during the recent years, and so has access to the Ha Giang loop. It hasn't become such a touristy ordeal like the Sapa region yet.

<em>Here is everything you have to know to make the Ha Giang loop motorbike tour a reality:</em>
<h2><b>What is the Ha Giang Loop?</b></h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4651" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.weather-in-ha-giang.jpg" alt="Weather in Ha Giang is very unpredictable." width="865" height="643" />

The Ha Giang loop is a motorbike loop that acquaintances you with the northernmost province of Vietnam, Ha Giang Province, that borders with China.

The time to complete the Ha Giang loop route varies. You have to keep in mind that the key point is not to rush it out and enjoy each second. If you're prepared to ride through steep cliffs and bumpy roads, you will be significantly rewarded for your efforts!

Ha Giang loop is home of the most breathtaking mountain passes in all of Vietnam and even Southeast Asia. The Ma Pi Leng Pass is nothing short of magical!

On your way, you come across numerous ethnic minority communities, who have unique customs and traditions.

Of course, on each stop on the Ha Giang loop, there will be plenty of accommodation options available, even for shoestring budget travelers. You can enjoy the authentic family-style meal at most accommodations you choose.

Ha Giang loop and the province itself has gained some popularity among backpackers in recent years, but tourism is still in its early stages. That means that the Ha Giang Province is still untouched by massive tourism that is plaguing lots of places around Vietnam.

<script async="" defer="" src="https://widget.getyourguide.com/v2/widget.js"></script>
<h3><strong>Time to Complete</strong></h3>
The total distance of the Ha Giang loop is <strong>around 350 km</strong>. You can easily make it to over 400 km taking numerous side routes and a longer route back (which we encourage you to do, by the way!).

You can manage to complete the Ha Giang loop in 2 days, which we don't recommend since it's very dangerous to rush on these steep passes. Keep in mind that you will miss out of most side routes and amazing scenery if you decide to ride the Ha Giang loop in just 2 days.

<strong>Take at least 5 days</strong> for this journey for a memorable experience. That way, you won't have fears of missing out! So, do yourself a favor and take your time exploring all that the Ha Giang loop has to offer! You won't be disappointed, we promise!
<h3><strong>Road Conditions in the Ha Giang Loop</strong></h3>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4647" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.road-conditions-in-ha-giang.jpg" alt="A windy road on Ha Giang loop" width="1034" height="645" />

Road conditions between the main stops on the Ha Giang loop have drastically improved in recent years.

The loop is full of mountain passes that are carved into the cliffs that haul high above the river valleys and side roads that rush through limestone karst landscapes. The scenery itself is nothing short of breathtaking, and words can hardly describe the wonder of it all.

Expect paved roads in mountainous terrain, some rough sections and light traffic. There are still some rough road sections that are under repairs or suffer from landslides. Also, lots of potholes!

The ride through the Ha Giang loop can be challenging at times and we don't recommend beginners to drive on their own. You will often run into narrow roads and occasions where big construction trucks will block your way. The buses and truck drivers will drive like crazy and will seem to give little attention to safety.

Want to drive from Hanoi to Saigon after completing this stunning motorbike loop? Check out our <a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/hanoi-to-saigon"><strong>Hanoi to Saigon motorbike journey</strong></a> and learn about road conditions, routes, costs and more.

You may run up to animals such as water buffalos and cows that may block your way, and an occasional local too! Keep in mind that you should ride safely to not injure any locals (or yourself!) as the procedure can be quite extensive, especially if a local labels you as a tourist who has lots of money.

So, prepare yourself for some bad road sections and sharp hairpin turns, especially at the mountain passes that are nothing short of awesome! Make sure to ride within your limits, as overconfidence can cost you your life easily! Drive during daylight hours (make sure to depart at early hours, sunset in the North will come very soon!) and rest during the night.

Most importantly, do not rush! Enjoy all that the Ha Giang loop has to offer!

<h3><strong>Essential Items &amp; Equipment</strong></h3>
<em>Of course, there are some pieces of essential equipment that you will need to complete the Ha Giang loop. Here is all that we recommend warmly to bring with you on this journey:</em>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Small or Medium Backpack for Essential Luggage</strong> - with a backpack, there will be no need to carry around your potentially huge travel bags where all your luggage is. You can leave your travel bags in your accommodation once you arrive in Ha Giang. Also, make sure to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0764GXZ99/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=calisequipzon-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B0764GXZ99&amp;linkId=1d537f75b5fcd723e713cded6ed29d51" rel="nofollow"><strong>get a daypack</strong></a> if you're going to hike or take any of the side routes to have a lesser load on your back and your bike.</li>
 	<li><strong>Clothes for at least 3 - 5 days </strong>- as some roads are just pure dirt, expect to get dirty while riding the Ha Giang loop a lot!</li>
 	<li><strong>Hiking shoes or Boots </strong>- the terrain on the Ha Giang loop isn't something to underestimate. There are a lot of steep and rugged surfaces, and the flip-flops just won't make it a comfortable experience!</li>
 	<li><strong>Medicaments that you will need - </strong>make sure to get some anti-mosquito cream as these pests are everywhere! Also, bring all the stuff for your allergies, headaches and abdominal pain. We recommend taking some <em>natural medicine</em> that you will need to pack carefully, of course! (you can get it in Hanoi pretty easily)</li>
 	<li><strong>Swimming Equipment and a Towel - </strong>you will come across some waterfalls on the Ha Giang loop, and it would be a sin not to bask in these clear waters and let nature do its own thing! Go with a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01K1TWYEO/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=calisequipzon-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B01K1TWYEO&amp;linkId=ff223b2b5cfbcf84cab8ff46589eebf4" rel="nofollow"><strong>microfiber towel</strong></a> since it's getting dry very fast and it doesn't take much space in your backpack.</li>
 	<li><strong>Waterproof Jacket/Raincoat and a Backpack Cover - </strong>the weather on the Ha Giang loop can be unpredictable at some times, and you really want to be prepared for the rain. You can also use an extra raincoat as a cover for the backpack.</li>
 	<li><strong>Camera (digital or GoPro) - </strong>the vistas on the Ha Giang loop are absolutely breathtaking, and you definitely should document these moments! You can get a digital camera or a GoPro style camera for pretty low and reasonable prices here in Vietnam (we bought an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07F8VH6B5/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=calisequipzon-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B07F8VH6B5&amp;linkId=083626dd2a5367c408c361726e04fdb1" rel="nofollow"><strong>Eken H9k</strong></a> four our trip for 1,5 million VND, which is about $65)</li>
 	<li><strong>Mobile Phone with a Vietnamese SIM Card w/all the other accessories -</strong> you will definitely need mobile data that you can get from some of the Vietnamese SIM Card providers at the airports. This will give you access to all information regarding the Ha Giang loop such as maps etc. Make sure to save an offline map of the Ha Giang loop, just in case! Also, save contact details of your accommodation, so that you can call someone in case of emergency. Make sure to take your phone charger with you to keep the battery full of juice! Get a mobile phone stand to navigate the maps and all the information on the go!</li>
 	<li><strong>Sunscreen and Sunglasses - </strong>sun rays in Vietnam hit pretty hard with their UV index, even when it's cloudy. Bringing sunscreen is a must for warmer months if you don't want the sun burns! Also, sunglasses will come in handy when riding during daylight and will give you a decent cool factor (depending on the sunglasses, of course!). Get sunscreen from your country with you. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004XGPMFA/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=calisequipzon-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B004XGPMFA&amp;linkId=5c8344e839a402d0550e280d9b64811c" rel="nofollow"><strong>Check out the sunscreen</strong></a> that protected us on our trip.</li>
 	<li><strong>First Aid Kit - </strong>if any emergent situation occurs, you will have a first-hand antidote for such a situation.</li>
 	<li><strong>Cash - </strong>there are ATMs along the Ha Giang loop, but you never know if a need occurs and the ATM just isn't out there in your vicinity.</li>

<h3><strong>Best Time to Visit Ha Giang</strong></h3>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4659" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.best-time-to-visit.jpg" alt="" width="1181" height="781" />

In the Ha Giang Province, weather differs between dry and low season.

The best months to do the Ha Giang loop are in the dry season. We're talking about <strong>March-May and September-October</strong>. In these months, you can expect warm temperatures, clear skies, bright colors and almost no rainfall! These are definitely the best conditions for riding the Ha Giang loop!

The <strong>low season occurs from June to August</strong>. You can expect lots of rainfall and more rough conditions on the road. Road slides and other hazards due to rain are not uncommon. During the low season, the Ha Giang loop suddenly gets more challenging and the views will be constrained by fog.

Winter in the Ha Giang Province comes <strong>along in November and lasts until February</strong>, and it can be pretty harsh up there in the North. It can get bitterly cold with lots of fog constraining your vision. You won't come across such amazing views during the winter, and the ride will be more challenging.
<div class="single_post_info_box"><i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle fa-2x"></i> <strong>PRO TIP: </strong>Don't rely on the weather forecast since the weather is very unpredictable. We usually asked fellow travelers on Vietnam Backpacker Group about the current weather conditions.</div>
<h2><b>How to Get to Ha Giang</b></h2>
Now that we've skimmed through the things to know before doing the Ha Giang loop, one question still stands. How to get to Ha Giang? Thankfully, Ha Giang is connected to the capital and the neighboring provinces, so getting there shouldn't be a problem.

Read our complete guide on <a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/public-transportation-in-vietnam"><strong>public transport in Vietnam</strong></a> that will provide you with amazing tips on getting the cheapest transportation around the country.
<h3><b>Hanoi to Ha Giang</b></h3>
The Ha Giang loop is located 310 km north of Hanoi in Ha Giang Province. Arranging a trip to Ha Giang is fairly simple if you depart from Hanoi.

<em>There are several ways to go from Hanoi to Ha Giang:</em>

You can take a sleeper bus from Hanoi to Ha Giang. The journey will take about <strong>5 - 7 hours</strong>, depending on the conditions on the road. The regular price for the sleeper bus from Hanoi to Ha Giang is about <strong>150,000 - 200,000 VND ($9)</strong>. Book the sleeper bus on <a href="https://www.baolau.com/s/hanoi/ha-giang"><strong>Baolau</strong></a> where you can check out the recent prices and timetables.

Another option is booking a sleeper bus through your accommodation. The upside is that the folks at your accommodation will usually organize that the bus picks you up at the front door if you prefer that option. After all, private bus companies are more flexible than national buses, if you don't mind paying a bit more.

With the buses, you can choose to travel on the daytime bus or take an overnight bus. Keeping that in mind, it is recommended to take the overnight bus that <strong>departs from Hanoi at 9 PM and arrives at Ha Giang at 4 AM</strong>.

If you don't have any time pressing issues, and budget pressure, there is an alternative - renting a VIP van. This alternative is far more comfortable than a sleeper bus and is a bit cheaper. It will just take a bit longer to get from Hanoi to Ha Giang, but the price with everything included is around 300,000 VND (<a href="https://12go.asia/en/travel/hanoi/ha-giang"><strong>check out the current prices and timetables</strong></a>).
<h3><b>Sapa to Ha Giang</b></h3>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4661" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.sapa-to-ha-giang.jpg" alt="Rice fields in Sapa" width="1185" height="764" />

If you want to reach the Ha Giang loop from Sapa, you will need to take a <strong>7-hour minibus</strong>. The minibus departs from the central bus station in Sapa Town. These minibuses leave twice a day, at <strong>8 AM and 10 AM</strong>. The cost of the ride is <strong>150,000 VND</strong> and you will pay that amount directly to the driver of the minibus.

Check out about timetables and exact prices <a href="https://vietnamlocalbus.com/sapa-to-ha-giang"><strong>here</strong></a>.

Make sure that you organize the minibus ride a day before departure through your accommodation in Sapa. They will gladly contact the bus company to reserve you a spot in the minibus.

After that, prepare to cover almost <strong>250 km from Sapa to Ha Giang</strong>!
<h2><b>Renting a Motorbike in Ha Giang</b></h2>
<div class="single_post_info_box"><i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle fa-2x"></i> <strong>IMPORTANT NOTICE: </strong>Before we go any deeper into the motorbike rental process in Ha Giang, as of 31 October 2018, all foreign riders in Ha Giang Province need to have a Vietnamese license or the International Driving Permit (IDP).</div>
Regarding the IDP, ask around your rental company for further details to get a first-hand outlook on the current situation. Also, don't forget to read our guide on <a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/vietnamese-driving-license"><strong>getting a Vietnamese driving license</strong></a>.

Read the <strong><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/comments/9sy2h3/update_to_police_stopping_foreign_motorbike/">ongoing discussion on police situation around Ha Giang loop</a></strong> and stay updated.

There are also some reported situations of police officers letting people go without the IDP for a small bribe. We wrote a <a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/vietnamese-police-guide"><strong>guide on dealing with Vietnamese police</strong></a> where you can get interesting information on getting out of a sketchy situation.

You can easily rent a motorbike in Ha Giang. The best place to rent a motorbike for the Ha Giang loop is <strong>QT Motorbikes</strong>. There is no need to book the bikes ahead as they have a lot of bikes in stock. They have a choice of manual and semi-automatic bikes.

Expect to pay <strong>250,000 VND/day for a 125cc semi-automatic bike</strong>. They offer Honda, Yamaha, Suzuki and dirt bike types. Of course, all bikes have been previously serviced, include a helmet and full gas tanks.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4646" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.renting-motorbike.jpg" alt="There are various options when it comes to renting a bike on the loop." width="1032" height="640" />

QT Motorbikes also offer top-notch advice for route details of the Ha Giang loop, which comes in handy!

Other than QT Motorbikes, there are numerous other bike rental shops. Make sure to <strong>check their reviews online to check their validity</strong>.

Renting a motorbike in <strong>Bong Hostel</strong> is also recommended. They have bikes of awesome quality. Other than bikes, they also provide accessories that you will need on your journey, such as bungee cords, gloves, helmets and more!

If you're a first-time motorbike rider, they also offer free motorbike lessons! The folks from Bong Hostel will also give you a detailed map of the Ha Giang loop and a huge amount of tips and recommendations for the road.

<em>Their daily rental tariffs for the bikes are:</em>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>135cc Automatic Bike </strong>- 200,000 VND/day</li>

<div class="single_post_info_box"><i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle fa-2x"></i> <strong>PRO TIP:</strong> it is definitely possible to complete the Ha Giang loop on a powerful automatic motorbike, but it is recommended that you take a semi-auto bike or a manual bike. The main reason is that you don't have that much gear control on the automatic bike like with other bikes, and you will need all the control you can get on the demanding sections of the Ha Giang loop. If you're riding a geared bike for the first time, don't be afraid, as many bike rental shops offer free bike lessons.</div>
Officially, foreign travelers still need a permit to visit the Ha Giang Province area. Nowadays, this is just a formality, and travelers can simply <strong>buy the permit for 200,000 - 300,000 VND ($10)</strong> at the accommodation located anywhere on the Ha Giang loop. That includes Ha Giang, Yen Minh, Dong Van and Meo Vac. Remember, your passport is required while getting the permit, so it's best to get it on the day of arrival!

<em>Of course, after renting your bike, make sure to visit a mechanic to check out a few things:</em>
<ul>
 	<li>Check the oil and change it if you need - the oil change should cost you about 100,000 VND and will be sufficient for the whole loop</li>
 	<li>Check the brakes and tweak them</li>
 	<li>Check out that all the electric parts on the bike are working properly</li>
</ul>
Also, when you're renting the bike, insist on the inclusion of rearview mirrors and a helmet. Remember, if you get spotted by the police without having any of these two, you will be stopped for sure!

Another option is <a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/buy-motorbike-in-vietnam"><strong>buying your own bike in Vietnam</strong></a>. The bike can be a hit or miss, so we advise to spend a bit more on getting a reliable bike. Aim for real Honda, Yamaha or Suzuki bike. These are reliable and mechanics know how to fix and maintain these.

If you're not confident with riding a bike on the Ha Giang loop, there is an option of taking a car drive around the loop. You can easily rent a 5-seated car and an experienced driver that can take you around the Ha Giang loop for around <strong>3 million VND ($130)</strong>. Check your accommodation for more info about car rentals in Ha Giang.

<h3><b>Ha Giang City Overview</b></h3>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4637" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.ha-giang-cit.jpg" alt="Ha Giang city views" width="973" height="620" />

Ha Giang is the capital of the province of the same name. Its population is 71,689, which makes it quite a busy town for the North. Ha Giang is certainly a lovely city situated on the banks of the Lo River. The translation of the river name is Blue River, which is ironic as the river is muddy and brown most of the time during the year.

Ha Giang is definitely the most comfortable place to prepare for the Ha Giang loop from every aspect as is a great place to relax after doing the whole loop.
<div class="single_post_info_box"><i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle fa-2x"></i> <strong>PRO TIP:</strong> ask around your accommodation for tips and recommendations for the Ha Giang loop. Locals know the best, after all!</div>
<h3><b>Where to Stay in Ha Giang City</b></h3>
You can find a lot of great accommodation on each side of the Lo River. The main streets on each bank of the river are called <strong>Nguyen Trai Street</strong> (west bank) and <strong>Nguyen Thai Hoc Street </strong>(east bank).

Regarding some sources, the east bank is more preferable if you're traveling on a tight budget, as it is closer to cheaper food options. There are plenty of awesome guesthouses and small hotels that are situated right beside the river, offering awesome views.

<h3><b>Where to Eat in Ha Giang City</b></h3>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4636" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.food-in-ha-giang.jpg" alt="Local market in Ha Giang" width="975" height="644" />

On the eastern bank of the Lo River (Nguyen Thai Hoc Street) are several rice eateries scattered around. On Vietnamese, these are called <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">quán cơm bình dân</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, so look out for these signs. In rice eateries, you point and order your food and look at the food being prepared in front of you. These eateries offer decent local food for <strong>30,000 - 40,000 VND (about $2) for a person</strong>.</span>

If you're looking for a feast (especially when coming back from the Ha Giang loop and from less than ideal food options in the villages on the way), you can try the <strong>bigger riverside restaurants on the west bank of the Lo River (Nguyen Trai Street)</strong>.

These restaurants are located on the right side of the street and you can find the street we're talking about just north of the northernmost bridge over the Lo River.

There, you will get access to some local specialties, like the salmon hotpot, for which the Ha Giang region is famous.

Also, there is an awesome place for <strong>rice breakfast on the 31 Nguyen Thai Hoc called <i>Phú Oanh</i></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

If you want to buy snacks, the Ha Giang central market is a great place to go.
<h3><b>Slice 1: Ha Giang to Tam Son</b></h3>
To begin the first leg of the Ha Giang loop journey, get on the <strong>QL4C main road and start riding north towards Tam Son</strong>. Just a few kilometers out of Ha Giang, and you will begin to awe at the limestone mountains and clear rivers along the road. The roads on this slice are pretty narrow and the air is really fresh.

Soon, you will reach the first major mountain pass - the Bac Sum Pass. It is full of hairpin turns with breathtaking views over the valleys below. If you have to refresh after doing this part of the slice, there is a cafe called <strong>Diem Gioi Thieu Va Ban</strong> that is situated in the mountains just after the pass.

Some 30 kilometers later, after traversing through breathtaking limestone valleys, you will spot a gate that will indicate that you have arrived at Dong Van Karst Plateau Geo Park. This area is the second UNESCO Global Geo Park in Southeast Asia that was designated as such in 2011. If you're more interested in this GeoPark, there are a lot of information boards along the road that explains the details behind the land formations in the region.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4649" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.tam-son.jpg" alt="Ha Giang to Tam Son road" width="970" height="642" />

Once you reach Dong Van Karst Plateau GeoPark, the road will take a form of a long and serpentlike ascent up the famous Heaven's Gate Pass or the Quan Ba Pass. The views from this mountain pass are jaw-dropping to say at least. Near the top of the pass is the viewpoint that offers even better views! There is an information center with a coffee shop located at that spot.

You can find it useful for your travels through the Ha Giang loop as there are various maps of the area available there. Behind the cafe are the steps that you can climb for an unconcealed view of the whole Quan Ba District, which is nothing short of awesome!

Make sure to take extreme caution while riding through Heaven's Gate Pass! There are some narrow twists and turns and the local driving skills may hinder you on your path too.

After the Heaven's Gate Pass, you will cross a treeless plateau that will take you down to Quan Ba District. There, you will arrive at Tam Son.
<h3><b>Tam Son Overview</b></h3>
Tam Son is located in a valley just between dozens of limestone hill formations. It's quite an inspiring location to say at least. Even though it's located it is quite an ordinary town.

There is one side route going from Tam Son, just after the gas station. Turn left from the QL4C and continue on the 5 km path to reach the Lung Khuy Cave.

This path will take you through small mountain villages, streams and the beautiful valley where you will eventually reach a car park, where you will need to walk for 1 km uphill to reach the cave.

You can take the circular path that runs through the cave that will offer breathtaking views over the immense cave, but with poor lighting.

If you enter through the left side instead, you will go through a more adventuristic path that has a lot of low hanging rocks. Duck under these rocks and you can descend steeply down into the mountain towards a dark pool of water.
<h3><b>Where to Stay in Tam Son</b></h3>
There are a few reliable places to stay that are located on the main street if you feel like you should rest for the night.

<strong>Kim Son Motel </strong>and <strong>Van Duy Hotel </strong>offer decent rooms for <strong>around 200,000 VND/night</strong>.

Also, there is a collection of homestays located in a valley that is just a few minutes away from the town. <strong>Dao Lodge &amp; Homestay </strong>is a superb option and <strong>Toongmun Homestay </strong>is reasonably good.
<h3><b>Where to Eat in Tam Son</b></h3>
In Tam Son, you can stop for lunch in one of the numerous roadside eateries. The best way to find them is to just pay attention to your senses!

You can stop for a drink at the popular <strong>Yen Ngoc Cafe</strong>.
<h3><b>Slice 2: Tam Son to Yen Minh</b></h3>
<h3><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4653" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.yen-minh.jpg" alt="Yenh Minh road" width="968" height="647" /></h3>
The second slice of the Ha Giang loop journey will start from Tam Son. Get on the <strong>QL4C and continue to the east</strong>, down to the Mien River Valley. Before you reach the Mien River Valley, you will most probably awe at a pair of round hills that look like they've been taken out straight from a fantasy novel.

You will pass through a series of hairpin turns going down to the valley, so tread carefully! This road will reward you with some amazing views.

After passing these switchbacks, the road will cross the Mien River and continue on to the north through a steep canyon. This bamboo-filled Mien River Valley is simply astonishing. You can see wooden house hamlets along the Mien River banks and children playing and fishing by the river as well as seeing them jumping in the river from the rocks. Really a humbling sight.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Before the road switch to the east, you will pass along the ruined fort of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cán Tỷ. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apparently, these ruins date to the French colonial period even though they look much older.</span>

Afterward, you will go through another long pass that will go up a pretty and refined landscape that is very close to the Chinese border. The climax of this long pass is the Yen Minh Pine Forest. This is a beautiful forest that bursts with positive energy. Also, it offers inspiring views to the valleys below.

After passing the Yen Minh Pine Forest, you will start to descend to the other side, to the Yen Minh District. There. in the distance, you can see the seemingly endless limestone forests of the Dong Van Plateau.
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b>#2: Yen Minh to Meo Vac (70 km distance)</b></h2>
<h3><b>Yen Minh Overview</b></h3>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4652" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.yen-minh-road.jpg" alt="River near Yen Minh" width="966" height="643" />

Similarly to Tam Son, Yen Minh is another small and dusty town located in a basin, surrounded by towering limestones and rice fields. The main road QL4C is cutting through the town, so it's very easy to navigate there.

Yen Minh feels very non-touristy an authentic. You can spot kids in side streets, playing football or volleyball. Curious looks from locals await you, and these locals are very friendly. They will usually invite you for a drink after having dinner in one of their restaurants.

Yen Minh isn't particularly charming, but it's a convenient stop on the Ha Giang loop where you can choose between a few accommodation options.
<h3><b>Where to Stay in Yen Minh</b></h3>
The main street in Yen Minh has a few hotels to choose from. <strong>Thao Nguyen Hotel </strong>and <strong>Hai Son Guest House</strong> offer clean rooms for <strong>200,000 - 500,000 VND/night</strong>.

<strong>Ha Anh Homestay</strong> is a place where a family-style dinner is served. That is a typical Northern Vietnamese homestay dinner where you get some type of meat, fried spring rolls, vegetables and cooked white rice combined with beer, of course!

If you want some calm and quiet, there is a place located in a lush landscape just a few minute ride away from the town that is called <strong>Sinh Thai Guest House</strong>.
<h3><b>Where to Eat in Yen Minh</b></h3>
Just as with the accommodation, there are dozens of rice eateries located on the main street. Your senses don't lie when seeking out these eateries.

For refreshments, there are a couple of cafes on the main street too!
<h3><b>Slice 1: Yen Minh to Dong Van</b></h3>
This 70 km part of the Ha Giang loop will take you through Dong Van and Ma Pi Leng Pass. The section we're talking about offers the most stunning roads in Vietnam, subjectively and objectively.

QL4C road cuts through awe-inspiring landscapes of dramatic limestone peaks and valleys that are millions of years old. The landscape looks like it came straight out of an idealistic fantasy novel, reminding of a forest petrified in time.

Surprisingly, the roads are equally as impressive as the landscape that surrounds them. In the last few years, lots of small paved roads have been completed, unlocking parts of the province previously unreachable by motorbikes.

<em>There are lots of isolated villages hidden in this marvelous area.</em>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4632" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.dong-van-back.jpg" alt="Yen Minh to Dong Van" width="972" height="645" />

This region is predominantly inhabited by Hmong ethnic minorities. The land is treeless and rocky, and by being so, offers little protection from various dramatic weather conditions that can impact this area. Crops are also limited because of the lack of fertile grounds. It can be pretty hard for the minorities to coexist with nature in this area, but they have managed to do so for many years.
<div class="single_post_info_box"><i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle fa-2x"></i> <strong>NOTE:</strong> Beware, travelers who come from Sapa! The minority people here may not be so hospitable as the people from the Sapa region, especially when keeping the business savviness of the minority people from Sapa!</div>
Another situation that you may possibly run into on this section of the Ha Giang loop is "beggar kids". One of the biggest problems that have risen due to the increasing tourist activity in the Ha Giang region is that the local parents have started sending their children to beg, effectively denying them a chance for education.

Lots of cases have been reported when children pose with travelers for a photo and then ask for money afterward. This <em>tradition </em>has made interactions between foreign visitors and ethnic minorities a bit uneasy, as the general perception is that the foreigner has money to hand out.

In these situations, do what you think is best; there are different ways to deal with such a situation.

If you want to learn more about the <strong><a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/scams-in-vietnam">scams in Vietnam</a></strong>, we wrote a huge guide that covers more than 30 scams we experienced during our time in Vietnam.

Back on the route! A few minutes out of Yen Minh, the road will fork. From this fork, you can ride the Ha Giang loop in either direction. In this guide, I will detail the route going northeast.

When you <strong>head northeast on the QL4C</strong>, you will be on way to Dong Van. Soon, a steep mountain pass will immediately bring you to the area filled with limestone cliffs. These rocky slopes are treeless, with no rice terraces and fertile valleys. Instead of those, you will see a lot of soybean plantations, sweet corn clumps and bamboo stands. As there are no trees in this area, most of the structures here are made of mud bricks or limestone blocks. You will pass along some walled villages in this area,

After buzzing through hilly and treeless valleys, the road will culminate on the <em>Nine-Turn Pass (<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dốc Chín Khoanh</span></i>). </em>This pass is one of the favorite photo opportunities for road trippers in Vietnam. You can see the road twisting and turning to a flat valley towered by limestone cliffs.

<em><strong>Here are also two side routes worth mentioning:</strong></em>

<hr />

<h4><strong>SIDE ROUTE #1: Pho Bang</strong></h4>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4645" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.pho-bang.jpg" alt="Pho Bang city" width="925" height="611" />

On the Nine-Turn Pass, you can take a left turn that heads north, taking you to the town of Pho Bang. This town is known for its market. There is a remote Chinese border there too.

This side route of the Ha Giang loop is worth taking if you have the time, especially in October. In October, the buckwheat flowers are blooming in purple, pink and white colors, creating a beautiful atmosphere.

<hr />

<h4><strong>SIDE ROUTE #2: Sung La Valley</strong></h4>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4631" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.backroadd.jpg" alt="Great views around Ha Giang loop are guaranteed" width="966" height="622" />

From the Nine-Turn Pass, continue a bit further and take a left turn to the Sung La Valley.

The Sung La is positioned slightly off the beaten path and is rarely visited by people riding the Ha Giang loop. This detour is absolutely worthwhile, even though the road to Sung La Village is a dangerous one. Remember, do not attempt this side route if you're an unconfident biker!

Eventually, when you follow the road, you will reach the peak of the mountain. This peak is 1500m above sea level and offers amazing views over the limestone mountains. The limestones seemingly stretch for eternity and you can see the bustling fields in the valleys below.

<hr />

Otherwise. just continue straight on, where you will end up in another stunning valley. There is a little homestay village at the bottom of this valley. You can spend a night in pretty local homes located there.

After more amazing scenery, there will be another road fork at Sa Phin. You can head over to Lung Cu (or the Vietnamese "North Pole") from this fork.

<hr />

<h4><strong>SIDE ROUTE #3: Lung Cu</strong></h4>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4639" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.lung-cu.jpg" alt="Lung Cu views" width="1046" height="645" />

If you want to reach the northernmost point of Vietnam, bear left to the north at the <strong>Hoa Da Guest House</strong> on a remote and scenic road that will eventually lead to Lung Cu.

This is a magnificent 45km loop that ends back in Dong Van. It is a popular pilgrimage route for young Vietnamese groups. Just follow the red T-shirts and patriotic locals, and you will find the flag tower in no time!

On the way to Lung Cu, the road will briefly run in parallel to the Chinese border. This border crossing is seemingly unguarded. You can see that motorbikes cross over this border crossing fairly regularly, passing a sign with a black skull and crossbones symbol.
<div class="single_post_info_box"><i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle fa-2x"></i> <strong>NOTE:</strong> This is actually an indicator for a minefield based on reports from fellow travelers, so every action beyond this border crossing is at your own risk!</div>
The entrance to Lung Cu or the "North Pole" costs <strong>20,000 VND</strong>.  This "North Pole" takes a form of a tall tower located on a small hill that offers breathtaking views over the Chinese Yunnan Province. You have to take some 500 steps to reach the top.

There are a couple of good homestays in this area if you choose to stay here during the night!

<strong>Ma-Le Homestay </strong>is located between Dong Van and Lung Cu. It offers a cozy accommodation experience that is very cheap with friendly staff serving commune style food.

<strong>Lolo Homestay</strong> is located 5 minutes to the west of the pole. It also offers a decent accommodation experience, based on its cheap price and the friendly staff that offers commune style food on its menu.

These homestays are great alternatives to staying in Dong Van. Dong Van has become increasingly impacted by tourism, as you can see from a lot of tour groups there.

<hr />

Take the right fork that goes to the south, then to the east at the Sa Phing junction to continue on the QL4C route to Dong Van. Just after the fork, you will run into a spectacular valley where there is a small settlement situated around a large stone building.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4664" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.hmong-people.jpg" alt="Hmong people" width="1186" height="768" />

This stone building we're talking about is called the Hmong Palace or the Opium Palace (the entrance cost is a few dollars). It is the former palace of the Hmong King, Vuong Chinh Ducbeing. This building is made of stone and timber and was made by French colonists in 1914 to keep the Hmong king happy. Of course, several different backgrounds are circulating, but this is the "official one".

This Hmong king had a fearsome reputation and was very wealthy, as he was growing opium poppies in this area.

Outside the Hmong Palace is a local market that is selling seasonal products. In autumn, you can buy walnuts, chestnuts and star anise.

Getting to Hmong Palace is fairly easy, as there is a signpost for the palace just off the main road. Then, you just go down a steep road into the valley.

From the Hmong Palace, there is 15 km of road left to Dong Van. This last slice of the road to Dong Van is an epic ride through limestone pillars that cast dramatic shadows over the valley. The road is cut right into the mountains, going right along the side of rocky cliffs.

Sometimes there are no barriers on this stretch of the road. Be extra careful while driving through this slice, especially when raining, as one slight skid could take you flying down the valley.

Along this road, you will see an occasional sight of women and girls from 10 years to 80 years of age that are carrying heavy loads of wood, hay, and crops on their backs. One peculiar detail is that the bodies of the older women have been completely distorted due to carrying the intensive load on their backs through the years.

Before you descend to Dong Van, the QL4C road is joined by the Lung Cu road at <strong>Bui Homestay</strong>, a popular resting place for Vietnamese backpackers.
<h3><b>Dong Van Town Overview</b></h3>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4633" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.dong-van-city.jpg" alt="dong van city" width="979" height="646" />

From the moment you step in Dong Van, you can see that it is a busy and dusty town. It has enjoyed a significant boom during the last few years thanks to the increasing travel interest in this region. You can call in the Sapa of the Extreme North of Vietnam.

This is the most touristy town on the Ha Giang loop, as the majority of travelers spend at least one night here. These days, Dong Van has a distinctive backpacker vibe going for it.

There are two markets in the town. The big weekend market is called <strong>the New Market</strong>. There, local women dress up in sparkling and brightly colored clothes that capture attention.

The smaller night market is held every evening and is called the <strong>Old Quarter Market</strong>.

The Pho Co (Old Quarter) is the busiest part of Dong Van. Before, there were just a few old stone houses with tiled roofs there. Now, local authorities have recognized the tourism potential of this part of the town. That resulted in a new row of these old stone houses being in construction.
<h3><b>Where to Stay in Dong Van Town</b></h3>
There is a handful of great places to stay in Dong Van.

The best hotel to stay in Dong Van is <strong>Lam Tung Hotel</strong>. It has excellent rooms with balconies that are perfectly situated between the two markets.

<strong>Ly Hoan Guesthouse </strong>is located next to the local market. It offers spacy rooms with large and cozy beds, air conditioning, flat-screen TVs and hot water shower.

Other places to consider are <strong>Hoang Ngoc</strong>, a fairly good mini hotel; and <strong>Hoa Cuong Hotel</strong>, the biggest and most luxurious accommodation option in Dong Van.

You can find dirt-cheap rooms that are aimed at budget Vietnamese travelers along the west side of the Pho Co Street in the old quarter of Dong Van. The mentioned rooms are styling themselves as homestays. Just look for the signs that say <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">phòng nghỉ tập thẻ.</span></i>
<h3><b>Where to Eat in Dong Van Town</b></h3>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4634" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.dong-van-food.jpg" alt="dong van food market" width="982" height="646" />

The best places to eat in Dong Van are definitely in the old quarter (Pho Co Street). There are lots of cafes and restaurants scattered around the town.

<strong>Nguyen Coffee </strong>is notable for awesome coffee and cinnamon-infused rice.

Some restaurants offer the local mountain specialties: h<span style="font-weight: 400;">orse meat (</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">thắng cố</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">) and hotpot (</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">lẩu</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">).</span>

For cheap meals, aim for the rice and noodle eateries in the morning and evening hours.

Decent cocktails are served here in Dong Van, a rare treat on the Ha Giang loop. Check out the <strong>Green Karst Bar</strong> for this treat!

Also, a local bar named <strong>Nha Hang Xuan Thu </strong>offers a wide selection of beer, cocktails, wine and local food. A pool table is also included!
<h3><b>Slice 2: Dong Van to Meo Vac</b></h3>
Before we head to Meo Vac, there is one side route heading to one scenic spot near Dong Van that you shouldn't miss!

<hr />

<h3><strong>SIDE ROUTE #4: Don Cao</strong></h3>
Don Cao French Fortress is located just a 5-minute motorbike ride from the town center. You will reach a steep driveway that you can ride all the way to the top of the limestone mountain.

Don Cao sits on top of the highest limestone peak in Dong Van District. It offers 360-degree views over the valley below.

<hr />

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4640" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.mai-pi-leng-pass.jpg" alt="mai pi leng pass" width="889" height="648" />

Waiting for you ahead is an epic 22 km ride through the Ma Pi Leng Pass (also called "The Happiness Road"). It is a stunning road that goes along the edge of a wall of limestone mountains.

These mountains tower around 1500 meters over the Nho Que river valley that is full of craters. This is one of the most epic mountains passes that you will see in Vietnam and the whole of Southeast Asia! The mountain pass is what the Ha Giang loop is known for treacherous roads, jaw-dropping views and adrenaline-fueled adventure.

It is an interesting sight to see the fields on these almost vertical slopes. Local farmers and water buffalos work in the fields deep within the valley. Stop for a while and you will hear echoes of local children playing and goats from way below on the banks of the emerald green waters of the Nho Que river.

You will need to ride 15 km along a terrifying but epic path carved in the mountains.

There is a viewing platform about halfway to Meo Vac where you can get some refreshments. You will come across a small tea house on the corner of one of the sharp turns around one of the mountain peaks. Park your motorbike there at the front and go through the tea house.

Exit through the back door where you will reach the spiral staircase that leads to the viewing platform. The viewing platform overlooks the breathtaking Nho Que river valley and the cliffs reaching to the bottom of the valley.

Head further, and the numerous twists and turns will give place to the epic views over a vast landscape that seemingly has no end. There are layers and layers crammed on each other.

If you're a photographer, you will definitely enjoy this slice of the Ha Giang loop that looks down into a narrow gorge created by Nho Que river. If you catch good weather there, this short slice of the road could take you a few hours, as the views are simply jaw-dropping.

This is apparently one of the deepest gorges in all of Southeast Asia. It will soon lose its majesty though, as there is a dam construction plan in mind for that area.

If you are craving for more of this incredible scenery, here is a perfect side route just for you!

<hr />

<h3><strong>SIDE ROUTE #5: Nho Que River</strong></h3>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4644" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.Nho-Que-River.jpg" alt="Nho Que River" width="1198" height="645" />

This route leads down to the Nho Que river and extends to the remote Chinese border.

The Ma Pi Leng Pass drops down to Meo Vac. There, you will see an appealing little road that hugs the mountainside on the opposite side of the valley. From there, you should take a sharp left turn and roll down through a series of tight hairpin turns all the way down to the Nho Que river.

You will come across a makeshift bridge crossing the river, where the road will go up the hillsides to China. After the bridge, the road condition will fall off rapidly in quality. As you get closer to China, the police may turn you back to the main road. Regardless of that, the awesome views make this easy side route a worthwhile endeavor.

<hr />

Shortly afterward, you will reach your next destination: Meo Vac.
<h3><b>Meo Vac Overview</b></h3>
Meo Vac is located in a basin that is sheltered by towering limestone karsts. This is one of the most gripping towns you will encounter on the Ha Giang loop. It feels larger that Yen Minh and Dong Van.

Some points of interest in Meo Vac are colonial architecture and a football stadium.

Meo Vac is quiet in the daytime but bustling in the mornings and early evenings. You can find a good day market and a new night market, as well as plenty of accommodation options.

On Sunday, the market gets a new look. As it is the biggest market in the region, you will encounter food sections, smartphone sections and livestock sections. The market starts working at 6 AM.

An interesting insight, this is not a market for tourists, but for the locals (you may call it a "real" market). You will see cattle, water buffalos, rice and corn wine on sale there.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4642" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.Meo-Vac-food.jpg" alt="Meo Vac food market" width="866" height="645" />

This market gathers lots of locals from minority villages in Meo Vac. They wear their traditional attires, something that you don't see too often. Kids gather around the stalls that sell jewelry and toys. Adults sit together and drink beer and corn wine. This creates a relaxing atmosphere regardless of all the craziness and chaos around the market itself.

The location of Meo Vac at the eastern edge of the Ha Giang loop gives it a remote ambiance.

Do not miss the viewpoint on top of a hill, that was a pagoda before! From there, you get an awesome view of Meo Vac and the surrounding area. It is a great place to drink a beer and watch the sunset.

To get there, <strong>follow the QL4C south</strong> and after passing the stadium, turn to the left on the road that goes up the hill. Follow that road until you see a car park to your right. There, just take the stairs that lead up to the viewpoint.

Another point of interest in Meo Vac to check out is the Uncle Ho Monument. It is located along the QL4C road, opposite the football stadium. The path to the monument is lit by lanterns, and the statue is lit too. That creates an interesting vibe.
<h3><b>Where to Stay in Meo Vac</b></h3>
There are plenty of accommodation options in Meo Vac. For budget options, check out the <strong>Linh Anh Guest House</strong>, that offers large rooms for <strong>200,000 - 400,000 VND for a night</strong>. Other notable budget accommodation options in Meo Vac are <strong>Mr. Hung Hotel </strong>and <strong>On Vang Hostel</strong> with capsule style lodgings.

We can count three good value mini-hotels in Meo Vac. <strong>Mai Dao </strong>and <strong>Huyen Loi </strong>are located near the western edge of the town, while <strong>Meo Vac Hotel </strong>is located right in the town center.

Arguably the best accommodation option in Meo Vac is <strong>Auberge de Meo Vac.</strong> It is one of the most atmospheric lodges in the entire region that is located in an old Hmong family home. A beautiful stone courtyard will await you while arriving there. Dorm beds on the floor cont only 300,000 VND for a night. There are private rooms that are quite expensive (50$ for a night). If you are planning to stay here, book ahead, as they don't have a high capacity for visitors.
<h3><b>Where to Eat in Meo Vac</b></h3>
Food in Meo Vac is a bit lacking compared to other stops on the Ha Giang loop. During Sunday (market day) get inside the indoor market. Inside the main hall will be many little stalls that serve various soups and rice dishes.

For barbecued food, check out the street just across the market. There are several decent rice eateries on the western side of the market. Cheap Banh Mi sandwiches are served in front of the market for great breakfast!

There are cafes around the main square that offer surprisingly great coffee!

<hr />

Two side routes that start from Meo Vac that offer a one way or a round trip are worth mentioning:

<hr />

<h4><strong>SIDE ROUTE #6: Khau Vai</strong></h4>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4638" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.Khau-Vai.jpg" alt="Khau Vai" width="1139" height="646" />

Road DT217 heads right out of the town and leads southeast, to Khau Vai, a market town. Further on, this route leads down to the banks of the Nho Que river where it steers through another rocky gorge.

Khau Vai is famous in these parts for its Love Market, that takes place in the spring season. This market has become a target for massive tourism, so it may probably be better to ride on this side route during another time of the year.

From Khau Vai, you can continue along the DT217 to Bao Lac if you want.

<hr />

<h4>SIDE ROUTE #7: Back to Dong Van Loop</h4>
This side route goes along the DT182 road. There is almost no traffic on this road or any foreign travelers. You will pass along the treeless landscape that is filled with conical peaks and tiny villages.

This route offers an interesting insight into farming in this harsh region. You may ask yourself how difficult it may be for locals to live sustainably in this beautiful and remote land.

<hr />

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b>#3: Meo Vac to Ha Giang (180 km Distance)</b></h2>
There are a few options to choose from to complete the Ha Giang loop and get back to Ha Giang. Whichever you choose, it will be yet another breathtaking ride through limestone karst scenery.
<h3><b>OPTION #1: Meo Vac to Yen Minh to Ha Giang (150 km journey - shortest route)</b></h3>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4668" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.meo-vac-ha-giang.jpg" alt="Meo Vac pass" width="978" height="643" />

Leave Meo Vac on the DT182 (it is also market as DT176 for some reason) that heads west to the Mau Due crossroads. This lower road passes through a treacherous limestone valley that has some dangerous sections, so tread carefully.

Bear right at Mau Due crossroads (due north) alongside a wonderful river valley. Eventually, you will loop back to Yen Minh. From there, simply retrace the route you took before on QL4C back to Ha Giang.

This path takes about 7 hours of constant driving. Make sure to set off in a reasonable hour.
<h3><b>OPTION #2: Meo Vac to Du Gia to Ha Giang</b></h3>
Taking this route will extend your return route to Ha Giang. It is definitely worth it as it is a beautiful and scenic side endeavor.

At the Mae Due crossroads, bear left (due south) on the DT176 road. This will be an extraordinary ride that leads through a mountain pass that goes over a chain of huge limestone peaks.

You will then go down on the other side through pine forests and valleys. At the final stretch of the road to Du Gia, you will make an amazing descent in an idyllic valley where a small village of Du Gia is located.

The road conditions between Meo Vac and Du Gia are fine for most of the time, but there are a few sections here and there.
<h3><b>Du Gia Overview</b></h3>
Du Gia is the least visited area on the Ha Giang loop. Regardless of that, this area is even more spectacular than the rest!

There are numerous activities nearby that can be arranged through your accommodation.

You can go swimming in the river. To get there, you will need to ride on a short, but treacherous 10 km road to the local swimming spot. At the end of the road, you will run across a dirt car park. Just park your bike here and hike along the edge of a fast stream for some 10 minutes and you will reach the falls.

You will most likely be greeted by the local children that will enthusiastically show off their cliff jumping skills. It is really amazing to see children actually interacting in nature rather than staring in their phone screens and social media.

Along with swimming, you can also go fishing and hiking around Du Gia.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4666" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.du-gia.jpg" alt="Du Gia from the top" width="863" height="643" />
<h3><b>Where to Stay in Du Gia</b></h3>
Du Gia has an offer of good homestays. The most authentic accommodation option is certainly <strong>Du Gia Homestay</strong>.

<strong>Du Gia Backpacker Hostel </strong>is the most western-friendly accommodation option. They have large and clean private rooms with a pool table and a shared dormitory. It radiates with a cozy family atmosphere. Other services that these accommodation offers are free water refills and apples, and hot showers with rooms that overlook the surrounding valley.

They also serve a family dinner that costs 80,000 VND. It consists of homemade pumpkin curry, fried fish, stir-fried sweet pork, fried garlic water mimosa, french fries, cucumber salad and rice. They also have an unlimited supply of "happy water", which is essentially a corn wine that will surely hone new friendships!

The cleanest accommodation option in Du Gia is <strong>QT Guest House</strong>.

All of these accommodation options offer cheap and communal dorms with mattresses on the floor under mosquito nets, with good family-made meals.
<h3><b>Where to Eat in Du Gia</b></h3>
You can eat family-style meals in the accommodation you choose that are on offer for visitors. The prices are very reasonable too!

<hr />

There are a few options to complete the Ha Giang loop from Du Gia, Keep in mind that road conditions may differ depending on the route of your choice.
<h3><b>OPTION #1: Via Na Sai (the shortest route)</b></h3>
Head south on the DT176 road and connect to QL34 at Na Sai. This makes for a long and difficult ride from a realistic perspective, as the road conditions will greatly deteriorate on both routes.

You should best avoid this route unless you are a true adrenaline junkie.
<h3><b>OPTION #2: Via Tam Son (the most scenic route)</b></h3>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4669" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.tam-son-village.jpg" alt="Tam Son Village" width="1009" height="646" />

Head back several kilometers north of Du Gia on DT176. Afterward, turn left and head west on the DT181. This road will lead you all the way back to Tam Son.

After riding this section, connect to QL4C and ride back to Ha Giang.

This is almost the perfect slice of the road. There are a handful of short but terrible sections of a very rocky road surface. Good all-around bikes won't have many issues on this slice. Even experienced riders on a semi-auto or automatic bike won't have many problems.

If you're an unconfident rider, these rocky sections may prove too difficult. In that case, it's best to avoid this slice altogether.
<h3><b>OPTION #3: Via Yen Minh (the easiest option)</b></h3>
Ride along the DT176 back to the Mau Due crossroads. Then, head north on DT182 to Yen Minh. Afterward, connect on QL4C all the way back to Ha Giang.
<h2><strong>Hit the Road Jack!</strong></h2>

Congratulations, you have completed the Ha Giang loop! I hope that you enjoyed the ride and that you've found this guide super helpful!

You will pass along the most beautiful landscapes and breathtaking viewpoints in Vietnam on the loop. The Ha Giang loop is particularly a great way to escape from the overcrowded tourist path in Southeast Asia.

On the Ha Giang loop, you will cross paths with local people who surprisingly still leave surprised and excited looks on their faces when they see foreigners visiting their villages. As much as this land is a wonderful sight for us foreigners, such is the sight of foreign people for the locals.

Ha Giang loop is challenging, and at times, dangerous ride. That makes it even more worthwhile!

After all, some roads don't lead home, but definitely lead to happiness, as the name for the Ma Pi Leng Pass suggests!

		<Content><![CDATA[Riding a motorbike from Hanoi to Saigon or reverse is probably the <strong>most popular road trip route in Vietnam</strong>. It is popular for a good reason. Between these two destinations, you will pass along the entirety of Vietnam through thousands of kilometers of roads.

Journey from Hanoi to Saigon will most likely be filled with many awesome experiences. The beautiful nature that Vietnam offers will astonish you. There are beaches all over the coastline, and the extensive road network connects most of them.

Also, there is a lot of limestone valleys and untouched nature that just calls you to explore!

And the people are a different story altogether! You will be astonished at how <strong>friendly and hospitable Vietnamese people are!</strong>

The best part is that you will get to <strong>experience the diversity of the whole Vietnam</strong> on this route! People, and even some of the traditions change as you shift from the North to Central and South Vietnam.

There are many possible routes from Hanoi to Saigon. Some of them are entirely coastal; some go on highways only, some on countryside… Our advice is to <strong>combine all of the road types</strong>, to get a more extensive outlook on Vietnam as a whole.

We will go in-depth on the route we took on our 1-month motorbike road trip through Vietnam. It may not be an ideal route, but we will try to give you a close picture of how it looks like to ride a motorcycle from Hanoi to Saigon on radically different road types and weather conditions. This journey proved to be quite an experience.

So, let’s begin!
<h2><strong>What Roads and Conditions Can I Expect?</strong></h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3952" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.vietnam-roads.jpg" alt="What should you expect from the roads in Vietnam?" width="769" height="577" />

First, let’s talk about the roads itself. Roads in Vietnam have names and certain markings, so it’s handy to know about the road terminology in Vietnam.

There are several road types in Vietnam:

<strong>National Roads (QL)</strong> – National roads are paved and are in the best condition. Also, AH1 is another name for QL1A, which is the main highway. Most travelers prefer to ride on QL roads, as they are in the best condition. They are a bit dangerous because of the <strong>massive number of crazy truck and bus drivers</strong> that will be taking these roads. Also, you won’t see much amazing scenery on these roads (other than the routes beside the coast).

<strong>Super Highway (CT)</strong> – If you’re navigating Vietnam by motorbike, avoid these roads. Why? It’s simple. These roads are <strong>reserved for cars only</strong>, so you aren’t allowed to drive on these roads by motorbike.

<strong>Countryside Road (DT)</strong> – Countryside roads differ in condition. Most of them have holes and can be demanding to ride on. Also, <strong>watch out for the cows on the roads of this type</strong>, as these roads tend to connect villages along some major locations. Make sure to not drive at night on these roads, as there won’t be any light source other than your bike light.

<strong>Very Small Road (TL)</strong> – These roads are single tracks and are pretty rare. If you don’t drive in remote areas, you will most likely avoid these.

<em>On many roads, you can expect lots of dust and flies, especially near rice paddy fields! Also, cows are a regular part of traffic, so it’s not weird to see them just chilling out on the road!</em>

What about the weather conditions in Vietnam? Is it safe to ride during rain storms? The weather varies drastically depending on the region.
<h3>North Vietnam</h3>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3950" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.north-vietnam.jpg" alt="QL1A in North Vietnam." width="835" height="626" />
<ul>
 	<li><strong>December to February</strong> – it is pretty cold during this period, and you can even see snow in the northern provinces!</li>
 	<li><strong>March to May</strong> – this is the best time to ride around the North, as the weather is calm.</li>
 	<li><strong>June to August</strong> – pack up your rain gear, as this is the time of the rainy season!</li>
</ul>
<h3>Central and South Vietnam</h3>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3951" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.central-south-vietnam.jpg" alt="The magnificent scenery on the southern part of Central Vietnam coast." width="769" height="577" />
<ul>
 	<li><strong>July to October</strong> – rainy season. Pack up your rain gear!</li>
 	<li><strong>September to December</strong> – possibility for a cyclone. They are not frequent though.</li>
</ul>
Other than that, the climate in Southern Vietnam is mostly stable and should be enjoyable for a motorbike journey at any time of year.
<h2>Some Rules of the Road…</h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3953" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.rules-of-the-road-vietnam.jpg" alt="What are the rules of the road in Vietnam?" width="977" height="577" />

If you catch yourself in the traffic of Vietnam for the first time, you may be surprised by how chaotic it might be at times. There are some laws to obey on the road, but most of the people don’t pay too much attention to them. The road conditions aren't the best, and there are a lot of contenders in traffic.

In theory, you should drive on the right side, but you will soon realize that this rule isn’t universally applicable in Vietnam. Especially in large cities like Hanoi and Saigon, where the traffic can get so crowded that you will just <strong>swerve around like doing a slalom and honk to indicate that you want to pass</strong>.

Speaking of horns, they are an important indicator in the Vietnamese traffic, and you will need to use it a lot. <strong>Horns indicate the right of way</strong>; if you honk aggressively, you will be granted the right of way.

<em>But, not everyone with the honk has the same right of way!</em>

The <strong>biggest vehicles on the road are trucks and buses</strong>, and they are a sort of “road champions”. That means that they ordinate the flow of traffic and have the highest right of way on the road. So, when you hear a buzzing truck or bus honk, move away! They usually move at thundering speeds, and it’s not wise to oppose that - especially when you’re on a motorbike.

<strong>The speed limit is 60 km/h on the highways and 40 km/h or even less in towns</strong>. It is advisable to obey these limits, but if you’re feeling more adventurous and lucky, it’s your responsibility!

There are some <strong>police checkpoints on the roads of Vietnam</strong>, especially on highways, but they tend to leave foreigners alone. Slow down a bit when passing by these checkpoints to avoid unnecessary attention. If you manage to be involved in an accident though, be prepared to pay a hefty fine!

So, now that you know some basic rules of the road in Vietnam let’s check out our Hanoi to Saigon route!
<h2>Which Route Did We Take?</h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3954" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.hanoi-to-saigon.jpg" alt="The Hanoi to Saigon journey can commence!" width="1440" height="810" />

It took us exactly <strong>30 days to get from Hanoi to Saigon</strong> by motorbikes. The route we took during these 30 days <strong>took us 3,400 km</strong>. Our main destinations on this route are:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Hanoi</strong> – 3 days</li>
 	<li><strong>Ha Long</strong> - 1 day</li>
 	<li><strong>Trang An</strong> - 1 day</li>
 	<li><strong>Cau Giat</strong> – 3 days</li>
 	<li><strong>Phong Nha</strong> – 1 day</li>
 	<li><strong>Hue</strong> – 2 days</li>
 	<li><strong>Da Nang</strong> – 4 days</li>
 	<li><strong>My Son</strong> – a day trip from Da Nang</li>
 	<li><strong>Hoi An</strong> – 1 day</li>
 	<li><strong>Kon Tum</strong> – 1 day</li>
 	<li><strong>Quy Nhon</strong> – 1 day</li>
 	<li><strong>Nha Trang</strong> – 1 day</li>
 	<li><strong>Phan Thiet</strong> – 4 days</li>
 	<li><strong>Saigon</strong> – 1 day</li>
</ul>
Having so many destinations on our motorbike trip list gave us an opportunity to rest after a long ride. Believe me; the <strong>motorbike isn’t the most comfortable vehicle</strong> to drive on! Especially when there is a weather shift every once in a while.

At one moment it’s blissfully sunny. Another moment, it’s raining, and the road offers new challenges.

Our goal was to <strong>spend at least a day at each destination</strong> to get a feel of every destination. From the busy streets of Hanoi to natural paradises of Ha Long Bay and Trang An, Vietnam has a lot of things on the table. Especially for first-time visitors to Asia. You may even <a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/culture-shocks-in-vietnam"><strong>experience some cultural shocks</strong></a> on the way!

I’m sure that every traveler will find something to his liking in Vietnam. If you’re a foodie, you will definitely enjoy their <strong>diverse and fresh cuisine</strong>. Surfers will enjoy the <strong>enormous waves of the South China Sea</strong> on the south, in Mui Ne.

But, you most likely are interested in how is it on the road from Hanoi to Saigon. We must say, it was a really challenging experience, but one of the most rewarding experiences that we had in our lives.

Prepare to spend a lot of time on the road. Traveling from Hanoi to Saigon is challenging not only because of the many different conditions that can be on the road but also because of the time it takes to reach the destinations.

<em><strong>Note:</strong> Keep in mind that the average speed we drove was about 60 – 70 km/h.</em>

Here is the map of our route from Hanoi to Saigon to get a better understanding of how long this journey is actually:

<iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/embed?mid=1IFkwhEKARFob2n-YH8PQvYnXZZShIxXn" width="640" height="480" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe>

Now, sit back, get a cup of tea or coffee, and let’s go on a journey from Hanoi to Saigon!
<h2>Route #1: Hanoi to Ha Long</h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3751" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.hanoi-to-halong.jpg" alt="Route from Hanoi to Ha Long City." width="1007" height="328" />

First, the basic stuff. As you can see on the figure above, the route we took from Hanoi to Ha Long is <strong>173 kilometers long</strong>, and by calculations of Google Maps, it should take for about 3 and a half hours of driving.

Of course, you have to take in consideration that this calculation is made for ideal conditions, but as we said numerous times before; <strong>expect the unexpected in Vietnam!</strong> Some stops will be needed to refill gas, eat, drink and rest from time to time.

After <a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/buy-motorbike-in-vietnam"><strong>buying our motorbikes and the necessary accessories</strong></a>, we spent a day practicing in the heavy traffic of Hanoi and its labyrinthian alleys. It was a preparation for much more; the highway.
<div class="image_description"><img class="wp-image-3772 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.packing-up-hanoi.jpg" alt="Preparing for the first genuine ride in Vietnam!" width="1920" height="1080" /> Preparing for the first genuine ride in Vietnam!</div>
Finally, the day has come, and after packing up, we embarked for Ha Long Bay. Even before we left Hanoi, on the road to the city exit, Lovel lost the part of the main stand on his bike while passing the Nhan Tan bridge.
<div class="image_description"><img class="wp-image-3773 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.first-breakdown-hanoi.jpg" alt="It wouldn't be fun if there weren't some breakdowns on the road!" width="1920" height="1080" /> It wouldn't be fun if there weren't some breakdowns on the road!</div>
Well, that wasn’t a problem for the mechanic on Highway 14 (AH14). The good thing about highways is that <strong>there is always a mechanic around</strong>, so if you manage to get a breakdown on your bike, you will be safe to know that a mechanic is a dime away!
<div class="image_description"><img class="wp-image-3774 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.mechanics-in-vietnam.jpg" alt="You can find mechanics virtually anywhere, the challenging part is getting to understand them." width="4160" height="2340" /> You can find mechanics virtually anywhere, the challenging part is getting to understand them.</div>
About the conditions on the AH14 itself:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>It is a hectic road</strong> – lots of trucks and buses you will need to watch out for</li>
 	<li>As on every highway, <strong>there is a</strong> <strong>track for motorcycles</strong>, making it easier for motorcycle drivers to avoid the potential overwhelming traffic flow. (<em><strong>Note:</strong> watch out for those pesky rocks that may find themselves at the motorcycle tracks!</em>)</li>
 	<li>During the low season, <strong>rain may toughen up the conditions drastically!</strong> (<em><strong>Note:</strong> you will get used to it, trust us!</em>)</li>
</ul>
Some 20 km later, we’re connecting to the National Road 18 (QL18) that we will follow for the rest of this route, as it flows through the city of Ha Long. This route is <strong>less dangerous than the AH14</strong> as it is considered as a more remote road. Nevertheless, there is still a lot of traffic flow here.
<div class="image_description"><img class="size-full wp-image-3775" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.sunset-pho-place.jpg" alt="Enjoying the sunset before a Pho break!" width="4160" height="2340" /> Enjoying the sunset before a Pho break!</div>
<div class="image_description"><img class="size-full wp-image-3776" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.highway-restaurant.jpg" alt="How a typical highway restaurant looks like." width="1026" height="577" /> How a typical highway restaurant looks like.</div>
QL18 flows through a lot of highway villages. There is always a place around <strong>where you can eat, <a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/vietnamese-drip-coffee-guide">drink delicious and strong Vietnamese coffee</a> and tea, and just relax</strong>.

<em><strong>Note:</strong> Your back will thank you for taking a break occasionally!</em>

The QL18 route we took strategically bypassed Hai Phong (it is the third largest city in Vietnam and its largest port town).

This road is also <strong>pretty calm during nighttime.</strong> (which will come around 6 P.M.)

<strong>Heavy rain can come at any moment</strong>, so it’s always great if you’re prepared. We didn’t have decent raincoats yet, so we had to stop for half an hour and marvel at the flooding capabilities of rain in Vietnam.
<div class="image_description"><img class="size-full wp-image-3778" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.downpour-vietnam.jpg" alt="This is how downpour looks like in Vietnam." width="1026" height="577" /> This is how downpour looks like in Vietnam.</div>
After waiting out the rain, we finally entered the Ha Long City. We really enjoyed the roads in the city itself, lots of curves and you can really feel the adrenaline pumping through these roads.

Yet again, we were met with an <strong>example of Vietnamese hospitality</strong> here. We were on the road for almost 9 hours, and we stopped to rest a bit before coming to our booked homestay. Two locals were sitting at the table beside ours, and they invited us to sit with them.
<div class="image_description"><img class="size-full wp-image-3779" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.vietnam-locals.jpg" alt="Tasting rice wine with friendly Vietnam locals. Don't ask about the blurriness!" width="433" height="577" /> Tasting rice wine with friendly Vietnam locals. Don't ask about the blurriness!</div>
Imagine the situation: there is a huge language barrier between us, we can’t understand a thing from them, and they can’t understand a word from us. An amazingly ridiculous situation. But when they started with offering rice wine shots, we knew what they’re up to. After all, this is a huge part of their culture, and this was a way of welcoming us to Ha Long. Thanks to these guys for a fun time!

Now, for some numbers.

<em>It took us <strong>8 and a half hours to get from Hanoi to Ha Long along this route</strong>, and we only passed 173 km. The rain can significantly slow you down, so it’s really smart to get some decent raincoats that will make you able to drive during heavy rain.</em>

We stayed at Ha Long Bay for only two nights, but it definitely left a huge first impression.

<em>The place we stayed in for two nights was Ruby Halong Homestay. We were in a room with four bunk beds, and there was a balcony with a beautiful view. Free breakfast is included too. A pretty decent place to stay in, far from the city center. Just make sure to check out at the right time!</em>
<h3>What to Do in Ha Long in two nights?</h3>
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-3780 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.ha-long-cruise.jpg" alt="Cruise around Ha Long City and immerse in the vibes" width="769" height="577" />

<ul>

<ul>
 	<li><a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/halong-bay-vietnam"><strong>Climb up the Bai Tho Mountain for an impressive view over the Bay!</strong></a></li>
</ul>
Describing this place in a few paragraphs is really hard. We managed to avoid the tourist crowds and got to see the amazing UNESCO-protected Ha Long Bay for ourselves. Also, the city bursts with genuine atmosphere and we didn't see so many tourists around!

After staying for two nights in Ha Long, it was time to set off to our third destination; Trang An!
<h2>Route #2: Ha Long to Trang An</h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3752" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.Halong-to-trang-an.jpg" alt="Route from Ha Long City to Trang An." width="841" height="481" />

The route we took from Ha Long to Trang An is <strong>190 km long</strong>, and it should take almost 4 hours to finish according to the calculations from Google Maps. We took the route via QL10 to avoid the urban area of Hai Phong.
<div class="image_description"><img class="size-full wp-image-3784" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.packing-up-trang-an.jpg" alt="Someone is packing for the road to Trang An, someone is checking the map, and someone is taking photos! A dream team for sure!" width="1026" height="577" /> Someone is packing for the road to Trang An, someone is checking the map, and someone is taking photos! A dream team for sure!</div>
Packing up again, we set off immediately in the morning, as we knew that this route would take us much longer than the time Google Maps has calculated.
<div class="image_description"><img class="size-full wp-image-3785" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.vietnam-traffic-flow.jpg" alt="Taking a quick cigarette break and observing the traffic flow." width="769" height="577" /> Taking a quick cigarette break and observing the traffic flow.</div>
First, we drove for 84 km (from Ha Long to Hai Phong) on QL5B. This road isn’t paved, so it’s a bit dangerous as there are <strong>no designated lanes on the road</strong>. You just have to adjust on the flow of traffic, and everything will be fine!
<div class="image_description"><img class="wp-image-3786 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.limestones-road-vietnam.jpg" alt="The awesome limestone formations on the road are just jaw-dropping!" width="769" height="577" /> The awesome limestone formations on the road are just jaw-dropping!</div>
The scenery on this road is fantastic, you can see the limestones all around! Really mesmerizing road to drive on, just remember; <strong>pay attention to the road</strong> as well as your surroundings. You never know what might end up in front of you if you’re not focused.

After the first slice of the road, the rest of the route is just QL10.
<div class="image_description"><img class="size-full wp-image-3787" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.highway-intersection.jpg" alt="The village intersections are traffic hot spots." width="1026" height="577" /> The village intersections are traffic hot spots.</div>
This national road goes through many villages when you can just stop and enjoy the sip of the signature Ca Phe Sua!
<div class="image_description"><img class="size-full wp-image-3788" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.coffee-break.jpg" alt="Taking a break and enjoying a sip of local coffee - ca phe sua!" width="1026" height="577" /> Taking a break and enjoying a sip of local coffee - ca phe sua!</div>
Anyway, this road isn’t paved like QL5B, so pay extra attention to lanes. There are also a lot of trucks and buses on this road.
<div class="image_description"><img class="size-full wp-image-3789" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.nighttime-storm-vietnam.jpg" alt="How being chased by a storm looks like." width="1026" height="577" /> How being chased by a storm looks like.</div>
We were lucky enough to even drive on nighttime, which we definitely wouldn’t recommend while making a motorbike trip through Vietnam. The storm was chasing us during the whole way after switching to QL39A for some 10 km.

One thing that is also challenging while driving during nighttime in the countryside is the visibility. The <strong>roads are poorly lit</strong>, and there are flies everywhere. Remember, there are a lot of rice paddy fields in the countryside areas of Vietnam, so <strong>these fuckers will constantly try to get under your eyes</strong>.

If you close your visor, it’s even worse, as the flies will just pop into it, and decrease your visibility even more.
<div class="image_description"><img class="size-full wp-image-3790" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.mechanic-at-work.jpg" alt="After a bong hit, mechanic was ready to have fun with the Honda Wave!" width="769" height="577" /> After a bong hit, mechanic was ready to have fun with the Honda Wave!</div>
<div class="image_description"><img class="size-full wp-image-3791" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.energetic-kids-vietnam.jpg" alt="The energetic kids entertained us while waiting for mechanic to fix the bike." width="1026" height="577" /> The energetic kids entertained us while waiting for mechanic to fix the bike.</div>
We ended up in a small village just after Nam Dinh where we waited for the mechanic for almost an hour.

Anyway, the goal on this route is to <strong>pass through Thai Binh and Nam Dinh</strong>. Soon after, you will arrive in Ninh Binh, where you will most likely be exhausted from the long trip.
<div class="image_description"><img class="size-full wp-image-3792" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.ninh-binh-at-night.jpg" alt="Finally arrived to Ninh Binh!" width="1113" height="626" /> Finally arrived to Ninh Binh!</div>
<div class="image_description"><img class="size-full wp-image-3793" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.ninh-binh-exhausted.jpg" alt="Sitting down and having dinner and a smoke is a great way to deal with exhaustion. " width="1026" height="577" /> Sitting down and having dinner and a smoke is a great way to deal with exhaustion.</div>
<em>We finally arrived in Trang An Nature House after <strong>10 hours on the road</strong>. The high quality of this accommodation pleasantly surprised us.  Also, the view over Trang An was priceless. The hosts were also delightful!</em>

Of course, this route shouldn’t objectively take you guys 10 hours; it will definitely depend on your driving skill as well as the general weather conditions on the road. And always keep this in mind: <strong>don’t drive during nighttime</strong> as many sorts of wild beasts will attack you! (referring to pitch-black roads, infinite flies and storm chasing us during the ride)

Trang An pleasantly surprised us; no huge tourism, absolutely epic landscapes, and dusty roads that are perfect for a motorbike ride! Also, we were lucky enough to explore this wonderful place during constant heavy rain. This gives it an absolutely different feel though.

We stayed two nights in Trang An. It was time to start riding to our next destination; Cau Giat!
<h2>Route #3: Trang An to Cau Giat</h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3761" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.trang-an-to-cau-giat.jpg" alt="Route from Trang An to Cau Giat." width="274" height="492" />

Before embarking on the road again, we made sure to fill up with coffee and tea and get some energy from just looking at the epic landscape around us.

This route is pretty straightforward, as you will be mostly driving on the QL1A, the main highway in Vietnam. The road is paved and passes through a lot of highway villages where you can find food, drink and bike mechanics virtually anywhere. This <strong>journey goes for 156 kilometers</strong> and should take you about three and a half hours to complete.

Getting out of Trang An is a bit challenging, as the <strong>road condition is very poor</strong>.
<div class="image_description"><img class="size-full wp-image-3802" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.trang-an-road.jpg" alt="Expect some off-road conditions while in Trang An!" width="1026" height="577" /> Expect some off-road conditions while in Trang An!</div>
After getting out of Trang An, connect to the countryside road DT491 and follow it until you get to QL1A. On the way to Cau Giat, be prepared for rainy conditions during the low season and a lot of traffic from both sides.
<div class="image_description"><img class="size-full wp-image-3803" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.rainy-traffic-vietnam.jpg" alt="During low season, rainy conditions can complicate traffic conditions." width="1026" height="577" /> During low season, rainy conditions can complicate traffic conditions.</div>
Cau Giat is a village located just right on the QL1A, which makes it a quite busy town. We didn’t actually stay there all four nights, as we found great accommodation on the beach some 17,5 km northeast from Cau Giat.

Anyway, expect some <strong>high traffic density on the way to Thanh Hoa</strong>, and watch out when the rain starts pouring!
<div class="image_description"><img class="size-full wp-image-3804" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.hoang-mai-village.jpg" alt="Don't be fooled by the sights of paddy fields in Hoang Mai Village; there are some nasty holes in the road there!" width="1026" height="577" /> Don't be fooled by the sights of paddy fields in Hoang Mai Village; there are some nasty holes in the road there!</div>

<em><strong>To get to Quynh Phuong Beach from Trang An:</strong></em>
<ul>
 	<li>When you reach Hoang Mai village, turn left after 2 km</li>
 	<li>Continue along the DT537A road until you pass the bridge over Hoang Mai river</li>
 	<li>You’re on the beach!</li>
</ul>
This time, we were getting more confident on the road and managed to get from Trang An to Cau Giat area in <strong>under 4 hours of driving</strong>.

<em>We stayed in a bungalow on the Quynh Phuong Beach which wasn’t the best place to stay at. But, it was immediately beside the beach, so you could just get out and jump in the sea. That was the best part of this accommodation!</em>

Cau Giat was an interesting place as it looks like an uninteresting village at first glance, but there is a volunteer community rising, and the <strong>local community is warm and welcoming.</strong>

Four nights in Cau Giat was really an awesome experience. David and Lovel got to meet the volunteer crew Antonio was hanging out with. He <a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/starlight-english-center-vietnam"><strong>volunteered with Starlight</strong></a> for five months. Also, we discovered that a lot of exciting things hide in plain sight in seemingly regular highway villages on the QL1A road.

<em>Special thanks to Thach for letting us sleep in his house for one night!</em>

After four awesome nights in Cau Giat, it was time to say goodbye and set off for our next destination; Phong Nha National Park!
<h2><strong>Route #4: Cau Giat to Phong Nha</strong></h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3762" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.cau-giat-to-phong-nha.jpg" alt="Route from Cau Giat to Phong Nha." width="515" height="672" />

The next part of our route is starting from Cau Giat, passing through Vinh and driving through the idyllic countryside to Phong Nha. This part of the route is <strong>246 km long, and it took us 7 hours</strong> to reach our hotel in Phong Nha.
<div class="image_description"><img class="size-full wp-image-3815" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.coffee-break-road.jpg" alt="And of course, coffee break before hitting the main road." width="1026" height="577" /> And of course, coffee break before hitting the main road.</div>

Starting from Cau Giat, just drive along on QL1A to Vinh. There we sat down for some coffee and to rest for the road ahead. After saying our goodbyes to our dear friend, the road to Phong Nha awaited us.

<em><strong>Note:</strong> You may already know it, but in Vietnam, it’s really, really hot. And the UV index is very strong, even when it’s cloudy. Prepare to endure some sunburns or get a sunscreen. We also love to wear long-sleeved shirts that are chilly and protect from the sunburns!</em>

Basically, we are just following the QL1A from Vinh for another 163 km before transitioning to the countryside road.
<div class="image_description"><img class="size-full wp-image-3817" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.cigarette-break.jpg" alt="Trying to hide from the sun during a cigarette break." width="1026" height="577" /> Trying to hide from the sun during a cigarette break.</div>

On the way, you will pass through many <strong>familiar highway villages, towns and rice paddy fields</strong>, catch time to rest and eat as well as find numerous mechanics (you will need their services a lot, trust me!).
<div class="image_description"><img class="size-full wp-image-3821" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.sunset-highway-vietnam.jpg" alt="The magnificent golden highway sunset!" width="769" height="577" /> The magnificent golden highway sunset!</div>
You may even be lucky enough to catch a beautiful sunset!

As you’re driving pretty close to the rice paddy fields on this section, <strong>you will be constantly harassed by flies.</strong> They will do their finest to get inside your eyes, but it’s still bearable during the day.
<div class="image_description"><img class="size-full wp-image-3823" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.night-ride-vietnam.jpg" alt="Be prepared for an occasional night ride too." width="1113" height="626" /> Be prepared for an occasional night ride too.</div>
When the night comes, they are entirely different beasts. They will harass you until you get off QL1A and connect to the DT2B road. Then, just ride along this road for another 24 km, and you will reach Phong Nha!
<div class="image_description"><img class="size-full wp-image-3824" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.phong-nha-avenue.jpg" alt="Arrived to Phong Nha!" width="1026" height="577" /> Arrived to Phong Nha!</div>
We were driving during nighttime for at least 3 hours, and the DT2B road is just pitch darkness, with a few villages in between. Make sure that you pay attention to the road and <strong>check your lights</strong> if you want to stay on your bike!

<em>We stayed in the Rose Hotel for a night. It has an amicable staff and great rooms for three people! We definitely enjoyed our stay there.</em>

This ride was really worth it, as Phong Nha is really a fantastic place.

Did you know that the <strong>largest cave in the world</strong>, Son Doong cave, is located here? <em>Sadly, you need a tour guide to explore it, and the tours cost approx. $3000! Not for a budget traveler, for sure!</em>

Don’t worry about that though! Phong Nha is a vast place filled with <strong>lots of untouched nature and beautiful caves.</strong> You can squeeze out the beauty of it on a budget for sure!

As we said before, Phong Nha National Park is a beautiful place. The scenery is jaw-dropping, and you can drive through lush jungles while exploring the numerous caves around.

After filling up the batteries in the marvelous nature of Phong Nha, it was time to embark to Central Vietnam and get to Hue, the former capital of Vietnam.
<h2>Route #5: Phong Nha to Hue</h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3763" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.phong-nha-to-hue.jpg" alt="Route from Phong Nha to Hue." width="911" height="725" />

Riding from Phong Nha to Hue is a combination of countryside roads and the well-known QL1 highway. This route from Phong Nha to Hue is <strong>206 km long, and it took us 5 hours to reach Hue.</strong>
<div class="image_description"><img class="size-full wp-image-3829" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.route-to-hue.jpg" alt="Prepared for the route to Hue!" width="433" height="577" /> Prepared for the route to Hue!</div>
We packed up our things, refilled the tanks on our bikes and set off to Hue at noon. As we were riding through early afternoon, it was really smoking hot!

<em><strong>Note:</strong> Make sure to pack up a lot of water to stay hydrated!</em>

When getting out of Phong Nha, we took the QL16. This road goes through the countryside and is full of dust and flies. After 36 kilometers, near Dong Hoi, we connected to QL1 highway, which we followed all the way to Hue. This time, the traffic wasn’t that heavy.

<em><strong>Note:</strong> On most roads in Vietnam, there is a lot of dust and flies, and sometimes, it can be harder to manage than the traffic itself!</em>

This section of QL1 features some epic landscapes. You can realize that you’re reaching Central Vietnam at this point.
<div class="image_description"><img class="size-full wp-image-3830" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.rice-paddy-fields-break.jpg" alt="One of the numerous breaks. near the rice paddy fields, flies excluded." width="769" height="577" /> One of the numerous breaks. near the rice paddy fields, flies excluded.</div>

Also, there are a lot of places besides QL1 where you can get a <strong>refreshing Nuoc Mia</strong> or sugar cane juice! Really comes perfectly during the hot afternoons!

After five hours of driving, we finally reached Hue! We found our hotel in the center of the city and just walked around as the night was getting close by.

Hue isn’t that big of a city, and it’s really easy to immerse yourself in the vibes. Just walking around the Perfume River during the night or exploring the city center is terrific in its own right. Of course, there are some things that you absolutely shouldn’t miss while in Hue!

After paying a visit to the former royal city, it was time to ride to Da Nang!
<h2>Route #6: Hue to Da Nang (via Hai Van Pass)</h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3764" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.hue-to-da-nang-via-hai-van.jpg" alt="Route from Hue to Da Nang via Hai Van Pass." width="715" height="420" />

<strong><em>You can get to Da Nang from Hue via two routes:</em></strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Via Hai Van Pass</li>
 	<li>Via QL1</li>
</ul>
The thing is, the QL1 route is reserved for four wheeled vehicles only, so your only pick if you're on a motorbike is the <strong>Hai Van Pass.</strong>

If you ever watched Top Gear (the old school one!), you may remember Hai Van Pass from one of their episodes. We were hyped on this road as it is said that it is <strong>one of the most scenic roads in Vietnam.</strong> Of course, we chose the Hai Van Pass route, and it didn’t disappoint.

Hai Van Pass route will take a bit longer than via QL1. It’s a 10 km difference, and we think that if you are an adrenaline junkie, you will love the Hai Van Pass route!
<div class="image_description"><img class="size-full wp-image-3840" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.da-nang-route.jpg" alt="Preparing for the road to Da Nang!" width="1026" height="577" /> Preparing for the road to Da Nang!</div>
After exploring Hue, we packed up and were ready to go in the late afternoon. As you can see on the Google Map slice above, the route from Hue to Da Nang via Hai Van Pass should take <strong>almost 2 and a half hours on a distance of 100 km</strong>.

The moment you get out of Hue, you will connect to the QL1 highway and continue through scenic route for another 66 km, before reaching Hai Van Pass. Now, at this section, you should <strong>turn right on the scenic Hai Van Pass! </strong>As this section of QL1 is not reserved for motorbikes and oil trucks, you will need to take the Hai Van if you're on a motorbike.

Before getting on Hai Van Pass, what you will need is to prepare yourself for <strong>21 km of absolutely epic road that is very curvy</strong>. If you drive at night, drive slower, as there are a <strong>lot of touristic buses and trucks</strong> on these narrow and curvy roads!

You will pass along some fantastic scenery through this road and will really <strong>get in the flow while riding these 21 kilometers of road</strong>.

The second part of the road is even more epic, as you’re getting more and more closer to the Da Nang City. Be careful how fast you are driving though, as the road is really narrow!

After some 9 km of the road, the Hai Van Pass is over, and now you can connect to the QL1 and continue on to Da Nang!

We reached Da Nang from Hue in 2 hours via Hai Van Pass. Da Nang amazed us with its <strong>liveable atmosphere and proximity to the sea</strong>. We can say that we fell in love with this city as we rebooked our hostel to stay just one more night! It is the <strong>paradise for expats</strong>, for sure!

<em>We stayed in Fedora Hostel, which was simply amazing for the price! You also get free breakfast included, and the rooftop has an epic view over Da Nang skyline.</em>

<em><strong>Fun fact:</strong> After the motorbike trip with David and Lovel, Antonio eventually came back and set up his home base in Da Nang!</em>

Da Nang is a wonderful seaside city and is full of things to do! The main thing going for it is, of course, the beach; but the people and the general vibe are just too charming to let go of so easily. If you have less than 5 days you can easily <a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/3-days-in-da-nang"><strong>explore Da Nang in 3 days</strong></a> or even 2 days. We took a bit more time to relax after a tough trip.

Da Nang really left a huge impression on us three, but it was time to continue our Hanoi to Saigon road trip and set off to Hoi An!
<h2>Route #7: Da Nang to Hoi An</h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3765" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.da-nang-to-hoi-an.jpg" alt="Route from Da Nang to Hoi An." width="377" height="364" />

Hoi An is very close to Da Nang. It’s only a bit more than <strong>30 km away!</strong> We decided to stay in Hoi An for a night as we heard from so many people on the road that it’s simply a must-visit!
<div class="image_description"><img class="size-full wp-image-3861" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.fedora-hostel-front.jpg" alt="Ready to conquer more roads!" width="769" height="577" /> Ready to conquer more roads!</div>
Said goodbyes to the awesome folks at Fedora Hostel, where we’ve been staying in Da Nang for all these nights, and set off to Hoi An!

Getting out of the Da Nang City was easy enough. We already ran into our first problem on the outskirts of Da Nang – Antonio had no gas left in his bike!
<div class="image_description"><img class="size-full wp-image-3862" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.da-nang-main-road.jpg" alt="One of the many micro problems on the road." width="1026" height="577" /> One of the many micro problems on the road.</div>
Nothing that two guys with one flask can’t handle! David and Lovel found a gas station nearby, filled a bottle with gas, and filled the tank of the juiceless Honda Win!

After this, you just have to follow the Lac Long Quan for some 30 km, and you will arrive in Hoi An! This journey <strong>should take about 40 minutes</strong>, but we arrived there in 1 hour and 15 minutes.
<div class="image_description"><img class="size-full wp-image-3863" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.hoi-an-rooftop-chilling-out.jpg" alt="Chilling out on the homestay balcony." width="769" height="577" /> Chilling out on the homestay balcony.</div>
<em>The accommodation we stayed in was Joy Hoi An Homestay. I would gladly recommend it to anyone looking for budget accommodation in Hoi An. It is in proximity to the city center but also located in the calmer area.</em>

Hoi An was an interesting place to say at least. It didn’t leave a huge positive impression on us as we realized that it has got a <strong>huge tourist contamination problem!</strong> Streets are obnoxiously crowded, and you will be looked upon as a tourist by most vendors.

Make no mistake; Hoi An is an absolutely gorgeous little town. No wonder that it’s rated one of the top Asian cities to visit. Its architecture will leave you speechless! Lots of the wonders of this city will be hindered by huge tourist crowds and aggressive marketing on all sides.

We even came back to Da Nang the same night for a special reason, but we knew that a huge distance was waiting for us between Hoi An and Kon Tum!
<h2><strong>Route #8: Hoi An to Kon Tum</strong></h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3766" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.Hoi-An-to-Kon-Tum.jpg" alt="Route from Hoi An to Kon Tum." width="524" height="551" />

This was definitely the <strong>most challenging section of the journey</strong> for us. Before you tackle the Ho Chi Minh Trail, I just want to stress this: <strong>be prepared!</strong>

By that I mean:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Prepare your bikes for this route!</strong></li>
 	<li>You will need <strong>a few bottles of gas</strong>, as there are a limited number of gas stations on the Ho Chi Minh Trail!</li>
 	<li><strong>Prepare your mind</strong> for many obstacles ahead!</li>
 	<li><strong>Don’t ride during the night!</strong></li>
</ul>
As you can see on the figure above, the road from Hoi An to Kon Tum is <strong>282 km long</strong> and is a very challenging one. Make sure to start early in the morning, as you most likely won’t make it in 6 hours, as Google Maps say!

<em><strong>Note:</strong> It took us three a whopping 12 hours to reach Kon Tum from Hoi An!</em>
<div class="image_description"><img class="size-full wp-image-3871" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.hoi-an-packing-up.jpg" alt="Packed up for the challenging road ahead." width="1026" height="577" /> Packed up for the challenging road ahead.</div>
After packing up for the long journey ahead, we crossed the southern Cua Dai bridge and stopped at the mechanic to check our brakes.
<div class="image_description"><img class="size-full wp-image-3872" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.mechanic-brakes.jpg" alt="Checking out the brakes at the roadside Xe May." width="1026" height="577" /> Checking out the brakes at the roadside Xe May.</div>

Then, we continued 10 km on the Road 129 before turning right. We continued for another 10 km, where we connected on the QL1 highway.

Antonio got his tire busted, so David and Lovel waited for him on the nearby gas station for half an hour. We also had some hot tea, as the rain has started pouring. This was the moment when we knew – this was going to be a ride!

Now, on the QL1A, after riding for 2,5 km there will be two bridges en route to Hoi An/Da Nang. We crossed the left bridge to the village on the DT611 countryside road.

Some 22 km later, we’re already on the QL14E National Road! We stayed on this road for another 59 km before connecting to the Ho Chi Minh Trail.
<div class="image_description"><img class="size-full wp-image-3874" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.cows-road.jpg" alt="One of the numerous cows you may encounter on the road.

<strong>Be prepared for many hazards on this road</strong> including cows on the road and lots of holes to watch out for! But, not all is bad on this road! You will pass along some amazing scenery that will be simply jaw-dropping!

When we reached AH17 (or the Ho Chi Minh Trail) from QL14E, we were hungry as wolves, to say at least!
<div class="image_description"><img class="size-full wp-image-3881" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.humble-breakfast-ho-chi-minh-trail.jpg" alt="Two portions of this, and we're good to go!" width="1026" height="577" /> Two portions of this, and we're good to go!</div>

Luckily, there was this place at the intersection of these roads where we got filled up with food for the rest of the road!

Little did we know that this would be the most challenging part of our journey. There was 136 km of just the Ho Chi Minh Trail to get past by. And, wow, has it been a ride!

The Ho Chi Minh Trail is an amazing road to ride on for sure! There will be more of that fantastic scenery I mentioned before and lots of holes and cows in between. <em><strong>But when the night comes…</strong></em>
<div class="image_description"><img class="size-full wp-image-3883" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.darkness-ho-chi-minh-trail.jpg" alt="The dark side of the Ho Chi Minh Trail." width="1026" height="577" /> The dark side of the Ho Chi Minh Trail.</div>
When the night comes, the dark side of the Ho Chi Minh Trail shows itself. We were even lucky enough to ride on heavy rain and to be split up with no cash. We also had <strong>just one gas bottle on our three bikes!</strong>

This segment of the Ho Chi Minh Trail is pitch darkness, with just some little poles to light up the way for you. At the time we were driving, we were the only crazy people to ride on this rain. We saw just trucks passing by, with no motorbike riders on sight.
<div class="image_description"><img class="size-full wp-image-3884" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.random-viallage-central-highlands.jpg" alt="What a sigh of relief it was when we finally reached a village on this route!" width="1026" height="577" /> What a sigh of relief it was when we finally reached a village on this route!</div>
Thankfully, we reached civilization at one point, found an ATM, and refilled our bikes!

But, the rain didn’t stop. The darkness didn’t go away. This was just the beginning, albeit on a more positive note for now. There was even a moment where there were a few cows just chilling in pitch black on the road. If someone was riding over 30 km/h, it would’ve been a disaster, for sure!

With the half of the Ho Chi Minh Trail done, we reached a place where we could rest and wait out for the rain to stop. It didn’t stop at all, and we wanted to reach Kon Tum as soon as possible.
<div class="image_description"><img class="size-full wp-image-3885" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.tea-and-coffee-vietnam.jpg" alt="Warming up with coffee and tea for the second half of the journey." width="1026" height="577" /> Warming up with coffee and tea for the second half of the journey.</div>

To summarize, the Ho Chi Minh Trail is filled with holes and many other hazards; it’s a <strong>challenging and rewarding road</strong> once you manage to complete it!

A few hours later, we finally reached QL14E again. There was just 43 km more of riding in the rain, but now, there were lights from the settlements on the way! Also, much fewer holes and unexpected obstacles like on the Ho Chi Minh Trail that we conquered mere moments before.

After getting in Kon Tum, we really felt tired from <strong>12 hours on the road</strong>. We also felt that satisfying feeling knowing that we conquered this path on heavy rain and pitch-darkness.
<div class="image_description"><img class="wp-image-3887 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.hotel-window-balcony.jpg" alt="The view from the Hotel Window balcony." width="1026" height="577" /> The view from the Hotel Window balcony.</div>

<em>We stayed in Hotel Window for a night, which is pretty decent for the price you pay. Also, you get a balcony and a rooftop to chill on!</em>

After petting ourselves on the back for achieving such a feat, we were ready to explore Kon Tum the following day.

And my, what a surprise Kon Tum was! It was one of our <strong>favorite destinations on our journey</strong>. This place just radiates with different kind of vibe than anywhere we’ve been in Vietnam, and that’s what makes it so charming!

Kon Tum is a pleasant place with lots of history. It is also filled with amazingly friendly people. What we want to make known are the numerous ethnic minority villages around Kon Tum. You can explore some of them without a permit. Meeting these ethnic minorities will be one of the most pleasant experiences you will have in Vietnam. Also, lots of magnificent landscape around!

We were debating whether to go to Pleiku next or Quy Nhon. The shore prevailed in the end. So, our eyes were set on Quy Nhon!
<h2>Route #9: Kon Tum to Quy Nhon</h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3767" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.Kon-Tum-to-Quy-Nhon.jpg" alt="Route from Kon Tum to Quy Nhon." width="585" height="322" />

After riding a 12-hour route to Kon Tum, we were prepared for a bit longer ride too from Kon Tum to Quy Nhon. The journey from Kon Tum to Quy Nhon is <strong>193 km long</strong> and should take about 4 hours, based on the calculation by Google Maps.
<div class="image_description"><img class="size-full wp-image-3895" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.quy-nhon-route.jpg" alt="Ready to hit the road to Quy Nhon!" width="1026" height="577" /> Ready to hit the road to Quy Nhon!</div>
This Hanoi to Saigon route segment takes us through the southern exit of Kon Tum, connecting again on Ho Chi Minh Trail for a bit (AH17).

Thankfully, you will need to ride 14 km on this road, and it’s not that challenging like in the hills north of Kon Tum.

This countryside road can be compared to the AH17 segment we took on the way to Kon Tum. Spectacular scenery, lots of random rain bursts, cows on the road and many, many holes along the way.

After riding for 44 km, we arrived in Kon Dong village that is situated just on the connection to QL19 highway.
<div class="image_description"><img class="size-full wp-image-3901" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.springroll-local.jpg" alt="The delicious spring roll!" width="1026" height="577" /> The delicious spring roll!</div>

There, we had some excellent spring rolls that filled our energy up for the road ahead. Also, observing the local life in this village was immensely fun!

QL19 is, for the most part, a decent road to drive on. It goes for 117 km, right through to QL1A highway. On this road, we finally found out what the branches on the road should signalize:

<em>Lovel passed on the road section where there was a huge branch of the road that was blocking an oil leak. He passed right over the oil and fell from his bike. Ouch!</em>

So, when you see a <strong>branch blocking a section of the road</strong>, think of it as a signal of road hazard. You’ll thank us later!
<div class="image_description"><img class="size-full wp-image-3903" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.curvy-road-quy-nhon.jpg" alt="The curvy road segment starts here." width="1026" height="577" /> The curvy road segment starts here.</div>
On the halfway to Quy Nhon, the road will get curvy a lot. Also, goats may end up in front of you, so tread carefully, especially if you drive during the night.

Some spectacular scenery awaits too!

At the end of the road, you should connect to AH1 (or QL1A) and stick to it for 8 km. Then, connect to QL1D and ride for 9 km. At the end of this road, you will finally reach Quy Nhon. <strong>We drove for 8 hours</strong> between Kon Tum and Quy Nhon. That also includes an occasional break and filling up the gas on the bike.

<em>We got to our accommodation, Hotel Tran Anh, late in the night and got up on the rooftop to check out the city skyline.</em>

We didn’t know what to expect in Quy Nhon. It surprised us with its chilled-out vibe, no tourist contamination, and beautiful beaches.

Quy Nhon was a great place to relax in before riding to Nha Trang. We would definitely recommend visiting this peaceful beach town and immersing in its vibes!
<h2><strong>Route #10: Quy Nhon to Nha Trang </strong></h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3768" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.Quy-Nhon-to-Nha-Trang.jpg" alt="Route from Quy Nhon to Nha Trang." width="324" height="855" />

The route from Quy Nhon to Nha Trang is <strong>one of the most scenic</strong> we have encountered on our motorbike journey from Hanoi to Saigon. <strong>It goes for 215 km</strong> and consists of QL1D and QL1A roads. This route took us <strong>6 and a half hours</strong> to complete.
<div class="image_description"><img class="size-full wp-image-3911" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.leaving-quy-nhon.jpg" alt="Ready to hit the road to Nha Trang!" width="1026" height="577" /> Ready to hit the road to Nha Trang!</div>
After packing up, we were ready to leave Quy Nhon at early afternoon. Go to the southern exit of Quy Nhon, right after Big C supermarket, and connect to the QL1D road. You will ride for 27,5 km before connecting to QL1D. This road is in good condition and goes right beside the sea. Some amazing scenery will await you on the way.
<div class="image_description"><img class="size-full wp-image-3912" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.road-to-nha-trang.jpg" alt="The mesmerizing scenery on the road to Nha Trang." width="769" height="577" /> The mesmerizing scenery on the road to Nha Trang.</div>
After connecting to QL1A, just stay on that road until you get to Nha Trang. It’s 188 km long, and it’s the entrance to the southern part of Central Vietnam that looks amazing by the way.

You will pass along numerous rice paddy fields, be overwhelmed by the number of trucks on the road and the beauty of the coastal towns. Also, you can see <strong>many islands</strong> from the shore!
<div class="image_description"><img class="size-full wp-image-3913" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.paddy-fields-south-central-vietnam.jpg" alt="South Central Vietnam is nothing short of breathtaking." width="769" height="577" /> South Central Vietnam is nothing short of breathtaking.</div>

There is also a cozy coffee place near Hao Son lake that has hammocks and is perfect for rest time!

You will pass through Tuy Hoa and Ninh Hoa before eventually reaching Nha Trang.

Sadly, we just had time to stay here for just one night, as we wanted to split the ride to Phan Thiet into two parts.

<em>We stayed in Eighteen House PDC, which was a decent accommodation. It had a rooftop to chill out on too!</em>

Nha Trang has become an increasingly popular tourist destination thanks to the proximity of Champa ruins and many islands. Also, the party scene here is apparently bustling, so if you’re looking for a touristic place in Vietnam, Nha Trang is the one.
<h2>Route #11: Nha Trang to Phan Thiet</h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3769" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.Nha-Trang-to-Phan-Thiet.jpg" alt="Route from Nha Trang to Phan Thiet." width="672" height="567" />

After spending less than a day in Nha Trang (and trying to find something to eat during Siesta time), we found a mechanic who tampered with our bikes for several hours. In the end, we started the second part of the ride to Phan Thiet just before it got dark.

The route from Nha Trang to Phan Thiet is <strong>242 km long</strong>, and it should take about four and a half hours based on the calculations by Google Maps. Our ride from Nha Trang to Phan Thiet <strong>took us almost 9 hours!</strong>

Starting from Nha Trang, we drove along the Tran Phu road, where it was crowded with buses and bikes. Getting out of Nha Trang took us almost an hour because of the high conservation of touristic buses on this road.

Driving through the city, we connected to QL1C and drove for some 11 km before reaching the QL1A.

This section of QL1A is split into <strong>two segments:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Bigger segment is <strong>reserved for buses, cars, and trucks.</strong></li>
 	<li>Smaller segment is <strong>reserved for motorbikes</strong> – very crowded!</li>
</ul>
The QL1A was split like that for another 10 km before getting on the real road. It was already dark, so we couldn’t see much of the scenery. The road is generally in a decent condition, some parts near Cam Ranh were hard to drive on because of very low visibility.

After passing Cam Ranh, we drove through the scenic route that connects to a beautiful chilled city called Phan Rang. If you didn't know, <strong><a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/phan-rang-kitesurfing">kitesurfing in Phan Rang</a> </strong>is one of the best in the country!

This section was 173 km long, and we found a great place for seafood and coffee (with hammocks too!).
<div class="image_description"><img class="size-full wp-image-3925" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.seafood-phan-thiet.jpg" alt="Someone enjoys seafood, someone doesn't." width="1026" height="577" /> Someone enjoys seafood, someone doesn't.</div>
When you reach Phan Ri Cua, that is the time to switch to the DT716B road. This section is 24,4 km long and will take you along the White Sand Dunes. The road is in pretty good condition, and during the night, there is almost no traffic.

Also, when riding this road during the night, you just get that feeling like you’re at the end of the world. You can see the black void that the sea is forming, and you can feel the sand from the dunes splashing over your face. Really an unforgettable feeling!
<div class="image_description"><img class="size-full wp-image-3926" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.pitch-black-road.jpg" alt="Riding through the pitch black void." width="1026" height="577" /> Riding through the pitch black void.</div>
Anyway, when you reach the end of this section, now is the time to get cautious.

There are a lot of talks on <strong>police patrols patrolling the DT716 road</strong>, just between White Sand Dunes and the Red Sand Dunes.
<div class="image_description"><img class="wp-image-3927 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.phan-thiet-police-patrol.jpg" alt="You may end up in a police patrol on this section." width="873" height="833" /> Where you may run into a police patrol.</div>
To avoid the unnecessary danger of a police patrol, <strong>we took an alternate route</strong> that is two times longer on a distance perspective, but safer from the law perspective.

<em>If you get caught by Vietnamese police, <a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/vietnamese-police-guide"><strong>how should you deal with them?</strong></a></em>
<div class="image_description"><img class="size-full wp-image-3928" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.police-patrol-phan-thiet.jpg" alt="The alternate route, bypassing the patrol." width="882" height="504" /> The alternate route, bypassing the patrol.</div>
The alternate route connects to DT715 countryside road and is decent to ride on. This section should take you about 40 minutes to complete. Voilla! You’re in Phan Thiet, and you avoided the dreaded police patrol!
<div class="image_description"><img class="size-full wp-image-3929" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.sunlight-bungalow-phan-thiet.jpg" alt="Sunlight Bungalow was perfect for a few days of relaxation." width="769" height="577" /> Sunlight Bungalow was perfect for a few days of relaxation.</div>
<em>We finally came to our Sunlight Bungalow and were amazed by what we got for such a low price!</em>

Now, Phan Thiet is an amazing place to relax in! There is something for everyone; pristine beaches, crazy nightlife, surfing opportunities, epic waves and much more!

We stayed there for five nights, and even though the weather hasn’t served us in the best way possible, we really enjoyed Phan Thiet!

Phan Thiet has become an increasingly popular destination for foreign visitors to Vietnam, and for a good reason.

After recharging our batteries from the long trip we had so far, it was time for the last ride!
<h2>Route #12: Phan Thiet to Saigon</h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3770" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.Phan-Thiet-to-Saigon.jpg" alt="Route from Phan Thiet to Saigon." width="1196" height="245" />

The final section of the Hanoi to Saigon route is <strong>197 km long</strong>, starting from Phan Thiet and ending in Saigon (or Ho Chi Minh City). It took us about <strong>5 and a half hours</strong> to reach our final destination.
<div class="image_description"><img class="size-full wp-image-3938" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.last-road-to-saigon.jpg" alt="Preparing for the final ride on this journey." width="1026" height="577" /> Preparing for the final ride on this journey.</div>
After packing up and saying goodbye to the awesome Phan Thiet, we set off for Saigon! The route is pretty straightforward; you leave Phan Thiet and connect to QL1A. Expect to ride on QL1A for the whole duration.
<div class="image_description"><img class="size-full wp-image-3939" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.south-vietnam-forest.jpg" alt="Lots of lush forests on the way to Saigon." width="769" height="577" /> Lots of lush forests on the way to Saigon.</div>

Southern Vietnam offers some amazing scenery, but also <strong>lots of dust and truck traffic jams</strong> on the road! Watch out how fast are you driving, as the truck drivers are even crazier when it comes to speed!
<div class="image_description"><img class="size-full wp-image-3943" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.long-khanh-sunset.jpg" alt="Early sunset in Long Khanh." width="1026" height="577" /> Early sunset in Long Khanh.</div>
Halfway on this first segment, when you reach Long Khanh (after 126 km), stay on QL1A.
<div class="image_description"><img class="size-full wp-image-3944" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.intersection-saigon.jpg" alt="Waiting for the third biker on the intersection before Saigon." width="769" height="577" /> Waiting for the third biker on the intersection before Saigon.</div>
After 21 km there will be an intersection between QL1A and QL51. Keep to the right and stay on QL1. Eventually, you will reach Saigon.
<div class="image_description"><img class="size-full wp-image-3945" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.traffic-jam-saigon.jpg" alt="You know that you've reached Saigon when you end up in a traffic jam like this one!" width="1026" height="577" /> You know that you've reached Saigon when you end up in a traffic jam like this one!</div>
You will be met with <strong>massive traffic once you reach the outskirts of Saigon</strong>, so riding to the city center should take a while. You will enter an intersection of QL1A and QL52, so now, it’s up to you which road will you take based on where are you staying in Saigon.

<em>We were staying in District 1, in Saigon Fantastic Hostel, so we took QL52 on the intersection.</em>
<div class="image_description"><img class="size-full wp-image-3946" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.seizing-saigon.jpg" alt="Seizing Saigon." width="1026" height="577" /> Seizing Saigon.</div>
Here, we finally knew – we seized Saigon! We immediately left our things and started to explore District 1. Didn’t have much time to explore further though; David and Lovel had to catch the morning plane to Hanoi the following day and we needed to figure out <a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/sell-motorbike-vietnam"><strong>how to sell our motorbikes in the last minute</strong></a>!

<hr />

A journey from Hanoi to Saigon is an <strong>unforgettable experience</strong>. You will learn so much about the culture of Vietnam and its people. Most likely, you will meet amazing people that will broaden your horizons.

Vietnam has a layout that makes it <strong>perfect for making a motorbike trip.</strong> This is just one of the many routes that you can take from Hanoi to Saigon.

Remember, <strong>take some necessary precautions before starting your trip.</strong> Make sure that your bike is in decent shape and that you have all the essential accessories. Also, bring loads of water with you, as you will need to stay hydrated at all times.

The <a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/vietnam-on-a-budget"><strong>budget isn’t that much of a problem too.</strong></a>

Once you’re ready, enjoy every moment of the ride. <em><strong>You will remember it for a lifetime!</strong></em>

<strong><em>We hope that we’ve given you enough information on just one of the many routes you can take from Hanoi to Saigon. If you have any questions or something to add, please do so in the comment section below. Cheers!</em></strong>]]></Content>

<div class="image_description"><img class="size-full wp-image-4043" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.internal-flights-vietnam.jpg" alt="Internal flights in Vietnam are cheap, fast, and prone to delays if you don't choose the right airline." width="1723" height="969" /> <em>Internal flights in Vietnam are cheap, fast, and prone to delays if you don't choose the right airline.</em></div>
We live in a time when most of us are in a rush most of the time. Of course, when traveling, <strong>sometimes faster is better</strong>. So if you have limited time, taking an internal flight is the best option. After all, a 2-hour journey from Hanoi to HCMC with plane <strong>compares favorably to 30-40 hours</strong> you would spend traveling by train.
<div class="single_post_info_box"><i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle fa-2x"></i> While getting on an internal flight is a fast option to get from point A to B, you will miss out on so many experiences you could get on the ground level!</div>
Of course, there are <strong>lots of budget airlines for affordable flights</strong> to all of the major cities in Vietnam. The most popular are:
<h3><strong>Vietnam Airlines</strong></h3>
<div class="image_description"><img class="size-full wp-image-4044" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.vietnam-airlines.jpg" alt="Vietnam Airlines is the most reliable choice when it comes to domestic flights in Vietnam." width="1024" height="576" /> <em>Vietnam Airlines is the most reliable choice when it comes to domestic flights in Vietnam.</em></div>
The national carrier of Vietnam. While the prices for some domestic flights may be two times higher than other airlines, their service is <strong>higher quality and more reliable</strong>.

Vietnam Airlines just got new planes too that are bigger and with seats that are more comfortable. You will also get a <strong>meal included</strong> on the flight! Nevertheless, this carrier operates a comprehensive and efficient network of domestic flights that are reasonably cheap.

If you value <strong>comfort, high-quality service, and reliability</strong>, you should definitely go with Vietnam Airlines.
<h3><strong>Jetstar Asia</strong></h3>
<div class="image_description"><img class="size-full wp-image-4045" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.jetstar-asia.jpg" alt="Jetstar Asia flights are almost two times cheaper than Vietnam Airlines flights, but are prone to delays." width="3000" height="2000" /> <em>Jetstar Asia flights are almost two times cheaper than Vietnam Airlines flights, but are prone to delays.</em></div>
This is the most popular carrier alternative to Vietnam Airlines. Generally, their flights are <strong>two times less expensive</strong> than the Vietnam Airlines flights. Well, that means that the service quality isn’t on the same level.

While you’re waiting on the Vietnamese airports, you will most likely hear many announcements on Jetstar Asia <strong>flight delays</strong>. Their planes are smaller, and there are fewer options regarding domestic destinations in Vietnam.

If you’re <strong>traveling on a tighter budget</strong> and are ready for an inferior service that often includes delays, then pick Jetstar Asia.
<h3><strong>VietJet Air</strong></h3>
<div class="image_description"><img class="size-full wp-image-4046" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.vietjet-air.jpg" alt="Inside a VieJet Air plane. These flights are prone to numerous delays, so make sure to book a few days in advance to be prepared for this!" width="1636" height="920" /> <em>Inside a VieJet Air plane. These flights are prone to numerous delays, so make sure to book a few days in advance to be prepared for this!</em></div>
This airline carrier is yet another alternative for domestic flights in Vietnam.

<em>David and Lovel took the flight from this carrier and ended up missing their flight back home from Hanoi.</em>

The flights regularly go from most of the domestic airports, but <strong>delays are pretty commonplace</strong> with VietJet Air. If you can buzz through inferior service for a few hours of flying and are prepared for numerous possible delays, then you can definitely save money with VietJet Air.

<strong> Don't make the same mistake as us and book the flight a day before the trip!</strong> You will wind up in a loop of micro-delays that can stack up in a more significant delay.

When talking about flight options, Vietnam is reasonably good when it comes to air connections. There are <strong>22 domestic airports</strong> that you can fly between. They are located all over Vietnam, so that travelers may get to their desired destinations in a lesser amount of time. Here’s a list of the domestic airports in Vietnam sorted by three main regions:

<strong>North Vietnam</strong>

Now you can see that Vietnam is pretty much <strong>connected by air all over the country</strong>. If you decide to travel to Vietnam by airplane, make sure to <strong>familiarize yourself with the ticket booking process</strong>!

Before you book any domestic flight in Vietnam, you have to <strong>present your passport</strong> (or rather, the passport number!).

The flights can be booked online with relative ease:
<ul>
 	<li><a href="https://www.vietnamairlines.com/vn/en/home"><strong>Booking for Vietnam Airlines flights</strong></a></li>
 	<li><a href="https://www.jetstar.com/au/en/about-us/jetstar-group/jetstar-asia"><strong>Booking for Jetstar Asia flights</strong></a></li>
 	<li><a href="https://www.vietjetair.com/Sites/Web/en-US/Home"><strong>Booking for VietJet Air flights</strong></a></li>
</ul>
When booking flights online, make sure that you <strong>check all the categories</strong>. You will get an e-ticket online which you can then print or present in the digital format on the domestic airport of your choice.
<div class="single_post_info_box"><i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle fa-2x"></i> If you want to catch the cheapest fare, chase the flights that are departing later during the day. These are usually the most affordable!</div>
Air travel in Vietnam has undergone some pretty positive changes during the last years. It is definitely the <strong>fastest way to get from point A to B</strong> in Vietnam. But, we wouldn’t say that it’s the most authentic way of traveling in Vietnam.

<em>Speaking of that…</em>
<h2><strong>Got some time to spare? What about a bus ride?</strong></h2>
<div class="image_description"><img class="size-full wp-image-4048" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.bus-vietnam.jpg" alt="Bus is the most common form of overland travel in Vietnam and is also the cheapest!" width="2400" height="1600" /> <em>Bus is the most common form of overland travel in Vietnam and is also the cheapest!</em></div>
Ah, the buses in Vietnam. We have already talked about them from the motorbike driver perspective, and how they rule the road. But, how is it like once you’re inside one of these buses?

Bus travel is the <strong>most common form of overland travel</strong> in Vietnam. If you’re traveling for short distances, we wouldn’t recommend them. You should enjoy in the long bus rides, after all!

Buses are the <strong>cheapest overland transport option</strong> in Vietnam. There are daily runs from all the major tourist spots that you can imagine! You can also book them in the last minute, which increases the convenience of bus travel in Vietnam.
<div class="single_post_info_box"><i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle fa-2x"></i> Many buses you may run into are overnight sleeper buses. You can fully recline the seats in these buses. That is comfort on another level!</div>
One interesting fact is that most travelers use buses to travel around Vietnam, but don’t actually see a single bus station! That is because a vast share of touristic journeys are made on <strong>services that are privately operated.</strong>

These services are usually referred to as <strong>“open-tour” buses</strong> - they don’t operate from stations but from the open-tour company offices. Open tour companies sell <strong>through-tickets between Saigon and Hanoi</strong>, with their customers free to stop off for as long as they wish at the main points on that route. The mentioned stops are (from South to North):
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Da Lat</strong></li>
 	<li><strong>Mui Ne</strong></li>
 	<li><strong>Nha Trang</strong></li>
 	<li><strong>Hoi An</strong></li>
 	<li><strong>Da Nang</strong></li>
 	<li><strong>Hue</strong></li>
 	<li><strong>Ninh Binh</strong></li>
</ul>
There are some drawbacks to doing this though!

Other than the mentioned private bus affairs, there are also <strong>national bus services</strong> entering the competitive game! They link all the major cities in Vietnam, as well as most minor towns. Travelers tend to use them only <strong>off the open-tour route</strong> though.

Why is that so? Well, we have already talked so much about the heat and humidity in Vietnam. Open-tour buses actually have <strong>air-conditioning</strong>, which is a godsend during the hotter days.

Also, they have <strong>limited seating and fixed timetables</strong>, which instantly give them a substantial competitive edge over the national bus services. The open-tour buses don’t pick up on the route, which makes them faster too! Because of the fierce competition in the bus transport market, prices are almost as low as the national bus network!

One example of the <em>inferiority</em> of the national bus services is the <strong>Mekong Delta to Saigon route</strong>. It is a 276 km ride that will last for about 8 hours in total!

What about booking bus tickets? There is an amazing application called <a href="https://www.baolau.com/"><strong>Baolau</strong> </a>where you can book e-tickets in most of Southeast Asia for buses, ferries, trains, and flights! Their database is regularly updated to match the real timetables. The advantage of this search engine is that you can <strong>always check the current schedules and ticket prices.</strong> That will save you lots of time you would spend looking for these timetables online or in the stations themselves.

You can buy the Baolau e-tickets <strong>online</strong>. The payment methods are:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>MasterCard</strong></li>
 	<li><strong>Visa card</strong></li>
 	<li><strong>PayPal</strong></li>
</ul>
After buying the tickets, your <strong>ticket will be e-mailed to you</strong> in PDF format. You can print it out or keep it on your mobile device as you will need to <strong>present it on the ticket counter from the boarding station</strong> before you get on the bus.

Now that we know some of the basic stuff about bus travel in Vietnam, let’s dive in-depth into some <strong>main bus travel services</strong> available to travelers in Vietnam!
<h3><strong>Open-tour buses</strong></h3>
<div class="image_description"><img class="size-full wp-image-4050" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.open-tour-bus-vietnam.jpg" alt="Riding in an open tour bus in Vietnam is very comfortable. Air-conditioning is included too!" width="2400" height="1600" /> <em>Riding in an open tour bus in Vietnam is very comfortable. Air-conditioning is included too!</em></div>
The open-tour buses are a <strong>reasonably comfortable</strong> way to get around Vietnam. They will <strong>stop at the occasional tourist sight</strong>, such as Marble Mountains, Hai Van, and Lang Co. This can save you much time and money compared to doing the same thing independent!

What about the bus quality though? Well, we can say that it’s pretty decent! Just <strong>don’t expect too much leg room</strong> (Vietnamese people are generally shorter than us Europeans!) or any toilets on board these buses. Some expensive services have them, but a significant majority of services will <strong>pull in every few hours for a toilet and snack break.</strong>

These breaks tend to be at subpar and overpriced restaurants, so it’s always a great idea to <strong>stock up on your own snacks</strong> before you start your journey!

Another downside to the open-tour buses is that you will be often <strong>encouraged to book into the hotels owned by the bus company or affiliate partners</strong> that are usually situated right next to the drop-off point. That doesn’t stop you from finding accommodation on your own though (check out the <a href="https://www.booking.com/"><strong>Booking app</strong></a> or<a href="https://www.agoda.com/"><strong> Agoda app</strong></a> to see reasonably priced accommodation)!

The open-tour bus services <strong>tend to run on time</strong>, which is surprising, based on the Vietnamese perception of time. On longer trips, some journeys will take place on the overnight buses.
<div class="image_description"><img class="size-full wp-image-4049" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.overnight-buses-vietnam.jpg" alt="Sleeper berths fill up the overnight buses in Vietnam, which are nice and comfortable to get some good night’s sleep." width="1000" height="667" /> <em>Sleeper berths fill up the overnight buses in Vietnam, which are nice and comfortable to get some good night’s sleep.</em></div>
The <strong>sleeper berths</strong> in overnight buses are an awesome way to get some rest!
<div class="single_post_info_box"><i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle fa-2x"></i> Don’t expect too much sleep though, as these are Vietnamese roads and drivers we are talking about! You will feel many bumps on the roads and hear many honks along the way.</div>
Keep in mind that some of the open-tour bus operators are more reliable than the others. The operators with the best reputation are <strong>Mai Linh</strong> <strong>and Hoang Long</strong>. Other than these two, some reliable open-tour bus operators are:
<ul>
 	<li>TheSinh Tourist</li>
 	<li>FUTA Bus</li>
 	<li>EcoSapa</li>
 	<li>InterBus Lines</li>
 	<li>Kumho Samco</li>
 	<li>Sapa Shuttle Bus</li>
</ul>
The mentioned operators are more reliable than others. Some other, unmentioned operators have abysmal service standards, so it’s best to avoid them.

What about the ticket prices for the open-tour bus services? The <strong>rates will vary</strong> depending on several factors:
<ul>
 	<li>What company you choose</li>
 	<li>How many stops you want to make on the route (if you are booking a through-ticket)</li>
</ul>
You can make secure ticket bookings at the outset or opt for an open-dated ticket for greater flexibility.
<div class="single_post_info_box"><i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle fa-2x"></i> If you book the open-dated ticket, make sure to book it <strong>one or two days in advance</strong> to make sure that you get a seat on the bus!</div>
We would also recommend to <strong>buy separate tickets</strong> as you go along your route.

You can buy tickets and <strong>make forward reservations from agents</strong> (one from each operator) on the each main town on the route.
<div class="single_post_info_box"><i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle fa-2x"></i> If you want to avoid being sold a fake ticket or paying over the odds, it is best to <strong>buy directly</strong> from a relevant agent rather than from hotels, restaurants or unrelated tour operators and affiliates.</div>
More or less, this is all you will need to know about the open-tour buses in Vietnam!
<h3><strong>National buses</strong></h3>
<div class="image_description"><img class="size-full wp-image-4053" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.national-bus-vietnam.jpg" alt="National buses in Vietnam are slowly being upgraded by the government. They are noticeably more uncomfortable than the open tour buses though." width="540" height="720" /> <em>National buses in Vietnam are slowly being upgraded by the government. They are noticeably more uncomfortable than the open tour buses though.</em></div>
Good news is, the Vietnamese government is <strong>slowly upgrading the state buses</strong> on the national bus network. They are replacing the old buses with <strong>air-conditioned models</strong>, especially on the more popular routes.

It isn’t surprising and uncommon to find yourself <strong>crammed among the luggage</strong> in these buses. The mentioned luggage could be anything from <strong>live pigs and ducks in baskets to sacks of rice.</strong> <em>Vietnam can be crazy sometimes!</em>

Progress in the national <strong>buses can be agonizingly slow</strong>, as the buses will stop to pick up passengers or for a meal break on a frequent rate.

Also, the <strong>breakdowns</strong>. They are fairly frequent among the older national bus models. Be prepared for that too, if you choose to ride on the national bus. The breakdowns can sometimes necessitate a wait on a roadside for several hours. Often, in these situations, the driver, fare collector, and mechanic roll up their sleeves, team up together and try to improvise a repair.

Regarding the tickets, it is best to <strong>buy them at the bus stations</strong> (or via <a href="https://www.baolau.com/"><strong>Baolau app</strong></a>) where you can see the fares above the ticket windows. The ticket prices are usually also marked on the tickets as well.
<div class="single_post_info_box"><i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle fa-2x"></i> There are still some cases of tourists being charged over the odds, which is very common in more rural destinations from the Lao border.</div>
For longer journeys, make sure to <strong>buy your ticket a day in advance</strong>, since many routes are oversubscribed. That can save you from many headaches for sure! We bought a one-way ticket from Hanoi to Halong Bay to experience <a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/halong-bay-vietnam"><strong>breathtaking views from Poem Mountain</strong></a>.

While the national bus service isn’t the ideal way of bus travel in Vietnam, it is <strong>slowly improving</strong> and should compete pretty well with open-tour bus companies.
<h3><strong>Minibuses</strong></h3>
<div class="image_description"><img class="wp-image-4051 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.minibus-vietnam.jpg" alt="Minibus can take you along some rural routes in Vietnam that aren't covered by the public bus services." width="1024" height="598" /> <em>Minibus can take you along some rural routes in Vietnam that aren't covered by the public bus services.</em></div>
The privately-owned minibuses compete with the public buses on most routes. They can be often seen sharing the local bus station or simply congregating on the roadside in the center of a town. That makes them really <strong>easy to flag down on the road!</strong>

These minibuses tend to squeeze in even more people per square meter than the ordinary buses, so <strong>don’t expect too much on the comfort side.</strong> They will often drive interminably around towns, looking for more passengers to cram inside.

At least, the minibuses run throughout the day and <strong>serve some routes that are not covered by the public bus services.</strong>

How can you book tickets for minibuses? The minibus services are <strong>ticketless</strong>. That means that you will buy your “ticket” onboard the minibus. Before doing so, make sure to:
<ul>
 	<li>Find out <strong>what the correct fare should be</strong> and agree on the price before boarding (bargaining is a must!)</li>
 	<li><strong>Have the right change</strong>, as it will come in handy and cause fewer complications</li>
</ul>
One downside on the minibus services is that you may find yourself <strong>ditched on the side of the road</strong> before reaching your destination. In case that happens, you will most likely have to cram onto the next passing service.

So, these are the main bus services you will encounter in Vietnam. Each of them have their pros and cons. Undoubtedly, the <strong>open-tour bus services are the best choice</strong> if you want the most value for your money though!

Well, there is yet another form of public transportation in Vietnam that will give you an authentic experience of Vietnam.
<h2><strong>Want an authentic travel experience in Vietnam? Hop on the train then!</strong></h2>
<div class="image_description"><img class="size-full wp-image-4042" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.trains-vietnam.jpg" alt="Trains in Vietnam are an awesome way to see the amazing scenery!" width="1840" height="1232" /> <em>Trains in Vietnam are an awesome way to see the amazing scenery!</em></div>
Riding on a train in Vietnam is a <strong>relatively safe and cheap</strong> form of transport. Also, you get to <strong>see much amazing scenery</strong> on the Vietnamese rail tracks!

The trains in Vietnam <strong>stop at all tourist stops</strong> between Hanoi and Saigon. They are generally <strong>more expensive than buses</strong> but are much more comfortable to ride on long distances as they have sleeper cabins.
<div class="single_post_info_box"><i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle fa-2x"></i> Make sure to book trains in advance, especially in peak season!</div>
Nowadays, few travelers choose the train ride in Vietnam, as the bus ride is much more affordable.

Let’s check out some <strong>benefits of traveling Vietnam by train</strong> that justify the higher price tag:
<ol>
 	<li>Major roads are mostly lined up with ramshackle cafes, gas pumps, snack stands, and mobile phone shops; with the train, you will <strong>see lots of beautiful countryside!</strong></li>
 	<li>You will be involved in <strong>much less near-collisions</strong> with trucks, motorbikes, cows, and whatnot!</li>
 	<li>There is a guarantee to get into an <strong>interaction with a bunch of friendly local people</strong>; maybe you will even be invited to join their feast!</li>
</ol>
What about the railway connections in Vietnam? Well, we can say that the <strong>railway infrastructure has really improved</strong> in recent years. Vietnam Railways has a single-track rail network that consists of more than <strong>2,500 kilometers of line.</strong> This line is popularly called the <strong>Reunification Express</strong>, and it stretches from Saigon to the Chinese border. The Reunification Express dates back to the colonial period, but the Vietnamese government frequently upgrades it.

Most of the train services in Vietnam are <strong>slow.</strong> Aside from that fact, traveling by train can be more pleasant than traveling on the road; you will be <strong>away from the busy and dangerous Highway 1</strong> and see far more countryside, even if you’re paying more (the coastal route is gorgeous!).
<div class="single_post_info_box"><i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle fa-2x"></i> Of course, keep an eye out for your belonging while traveling on the train! Do so especially when the train stops at the station. Some precaution measures are to ensure that your money belt is tucked safely under your clothes before you go to sleep and safely storing your luggage.</div>
The <strong>most popular tourist train routes</strong> in Vietnam are:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Da Nang - Hue</strong> (2-3 hours ride)</li>
 	<li><strong>Hue - Hanoi picturesque overnight train</strong> (11-16 hours ride)</li>
 	<li><strong>Hanoi - Lao Cai</strong> (8-9 hours ride)</li>
</ul>
Now that we are talking about the available <strong>train services in Vietnam</strong>, let’s go more in-depth!

Starting from Hanoi, <strong>three lines</strong> branch towards the northern coast and the Chinese border:
<ol>
 	<li>The route that goes <strong>along the Red River northwest to Lao Cai</strong>, it is just a one-hour bus ride away from Sa Pa and a site of the border crossing into the Yunnan Province in China (sadly, the rail on the Chinese side is out of order)</li>
 	<li>Runs north to Dong Dang, this route <strong>connects Hanoi and Beijing</strong> (ride duration is six hours)</li>
 	<li>A shorter line that <strong>connects Hanoi and Hai Phong</strong> (ride duration is 2 hours and 30 minutes)</li>
</ol>
Now, you can choose from <strong>five train routes</strong> in Northern Vietnam:
<ol>
 	<li><strong>Hanoi to Lao Cai</strong> (Sa Pa) - this is the busiest route, as many travelers come to check out the wonders of the Sa Pa region; there are also four-night trains (7-8 hour ride) and a day ride service (9-hour trip)</li>
 	<li><strong>Hanoi to Dong Dang</strong> - this route goes to the Lang Son province</li>
 	<li><strong>Hanoi to Hai Phong</strong> - a relatively short route to the biggest port of Vietnam</li>
 	<li><strong>Hanoi to Quan Trieu</strong></li>
 	<li><strong>Hanoi to Saigon via Ninh Binh</strong></li>
</ol>
Then, there is the main line, the Reunification Express. It has <strong>five services that depart daily</strong> from Hanoi to Saigon and reverse. The duration of this journey is <strong>between 30 and 40 hours.</strong> This main line shadows the infamous Highway 1 and <strong>stops in popular areas like Hue, Da Nang, and Nha Trang.</strong> Most of these services <strong>arrive between 3 AM and 5 AM</strong> in Hanoi and Saigon both.

The trains will <strong>usually leave on schedule</strong> from their departure points. There is a <strong>possibility of a delay</strong> always looming, but don’t expect anything too severe to detract you from traveling by train in Vietnam.
<div class="single_post_info_box"><i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle fa-2x"></i> The only reliable way to learn the schedules is to check them on the train station walls or online!</div>
When it comes to trains, you can <strong>choose between different classes</strong> that differ in comfort levels and prices.
<div class="single_post_info_box"><i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle fa-2x"></i> If you value comfort above all else, it is essential to aim high when choosing which class to travel in!</div>
<div class="image_description"><img class="size-full wp-image-4058" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.hard-seat-train-vietnam.jpg" alt="Hard seat trains in Vietnam have low hygiene standards, have caged windows, and are usually overcrowded. They are bearable for shorter journeys though." width="1024" height="683" /> <em>Hard seat trains in Vietnam have low hygiene standards, have caged windows, and are usually overcrowded. They are bearable for shorter journeys though.</em></div>
Starting from the bottom, the <strong>first class is the hard seat.</strong> These trains are bearable for shorter journeys. Beware of the <strong>hygiene standards</strong> in these trains though, it is common for the carriages to be filthy and the windows are caged. You may feel like an animal in this ambiance, and the views from such windows are generally poor.
<div class="image_description"><img class="size-full wp-image-4056" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.soft-seat-trains-vietnam.jpg" alt="Soft seat trains in Vietnam are air-conditioned and very comfortable!" width="1262" height="815" /> <em>Soft seat trains in Vietnam are air-conditioned and very comfortable!</em></div>
Going up the train class ladder, we are coming to the <strong>soft seat trains.</strong> These trains are definitely <strong>more comfortable</strong> than the hard seat trains. Also, the new carriages are <strong>air-conditioned</strong>, and some of them even have double decks!
<div class="image_description"><img class="size-full wp-image-4057" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.berth-trains-vietnam.jpg" alt="Trains with berths are the most comfortable, especially for overnight journeys." width="859" height="644" /> <em>Trains with berths are the most comfortable, especially for overnight journeys.</em></div>
Finally, we have the <strong>high-class trains with berths!</strong> These trains tend to have flat screen TVs that operate at ear-splitting volumes (nothing too severe to detract from the comfortable experience though!). Taking these trains are <strong>well advised for overnight journeys.</strong>
<div class="single_post_info_box"><i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle fa-2x"></i> You never know what you are getting with berth trains, as the rolling stock of berths is continually being upgraded!</div>
The cheapest option, when we are talking about berth trains are the ones with <strong>hard-berth compartments.</strong> These are quite comfortable and have <strong>six bunks, three from each side.</strong> The top ones are cramped and are the cheapest while the bottom ones are the priciest. A general rule of the thumb is; <strong>the more comfortable it is, the more expensive it is too!</strong>

There are also berth trains with <strong>soft-berth compartments</strong> which have four bunks and are always comfortable. Just <strong>expect to pay more</strong> for this luxury though!
<div class="single_post_info_box"><i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle fa-2x"></i> If you have trouble noticing the berth carriages, all of them are marked with <strong>SE1, SE2, SE3</strong>, <strong>and SE4</strong> tags!</div>
These luxury carriages are attached to regular services on a couple of routes that are going from Hanoi:
<ul>
 	<li>Livitrans operates the <strong>trains going to</strong> <strong>Hue and Da Nang</strong></li>
 	<li>A bunch of companies (Orient Express, Sapaly, Chapa and King Express) operate the <strong>trains to Lao Cai</strong></li>
</ul>
Regarding the quality of the trains in Vietnam, <strong>all Reunification Express trains have air-conditioning</strong> now, which is a real godsend! Also, the overnight trains to Lao Cai have air-conditioning and are upgraded with luxury soft-sleeper carriages!

All trains are <strong>theoretically non-smoking</strong>; this rule is mostly obeyed, at least in the sleeper rooms.
<div class="single_post_info_box"><i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle fa-2x"></i> It isn’t surprising to even see the guard having a smoke in the hard-seat class though!</div>
All train carriages have <strong>toilets of variable quality</strong>. It's really hard to know what to expect from these sometimes. Most of them are fine though, squat in nature and a little grubby. These are far more likely to be dirty and be lacking toilet paper and running water.

The toilets in the soft-sleeper carriages are the proper sit-down toilets that are comparatively clean.

Also, <strong>expect simple meals to be included</strong> in the price of the train ticket! You might want to stock up on your goodies too. Thankfully, there are a <strong>lot of opportunities to buy snacks</strong> when the train pulls into a station.

What about buying train tickets though? <strong>Booking ahead is wise.</strong> The general rule when booking a ticket is the <strong>further ahead from departure you book the better</strong>. That especially applies to situations when you plan to travel on a weekend or holiday periods.
<div class="single_post_info_box"><i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle fa-2x"></i> The lower sleeper berths are often sold as six seats, which results in absolute chaos!</div>
Train ticket booking opens about <strong>60 days before the official departure</strong>, in some cases even 90 days!
<div class="single_post_info_box"><i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle fa-2x"></i> During the peak period (like the Vietnamese New Year - Tet), book as soon as possible!</div>
When booking sleeping compartments, you should book them <strong>at least a day or two before departure</strong>. In some situations, it is advisable to book even further ahead, such as for soft sleeper berths on Hanoi-Hue and Hanoi-Lao Cai routes.

Keep in mind that it is <strong>impossible to buy through-tickets</strong> and break your journey en route. Each train journey will require you to buy a separate ticket from the point of departure.

Getting tickets is usually painless at the stations! Even hotels and travel agencies will be able to book a ticket, for a fee of course!

Fare <strong>prices will vary</strong> depending on the travel class and the train you take. Aside from the comfort level, the general rule of the thumb is: <strong>the faster the train, the more expensive it is!</strong>

The <strong>prices are regularly changing</strong>, so make sure to check them out before booking to see where you’re at. <em>Check out the <a href="https://vietnam-railway.com/"><strong>official Vietnam Railways website</strong></a> for the updated train schedules!</em>

We recommend you to book train tickets from the <a href="https://www.baolau.com/"><strong>Baolau app</strong></a> because train tickets can be sold out without your prior preparation. That ensures minimum stress! You can also <strong>choose your seat</strong> from the application, which is an added bonus!

If you book your train tickets from the tourist train companies (like Orient Express, Sapaly, and Chapa), you will have to pick them up from the departure station.

So, this is all that you need to know about train travel in Vietnam. It is definitely a <strong>reasonable choice</strong> for public transportation in Vietnam as it can be a quite comfortable and enjoyable experience.
<h2><strong>Up for island hopping or a river tour? Take a boat or a ferry!</strong></h2>
<div class="image_description"><img class="size-full wp-image-4055" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.ha-long-bay-cruise.jpg" alt="Ha Long Bay cruise is an awesome way to explore the numerous islands of this beautiful bay! Other than this, there are numerous ferries that sail to other islands." width="1214" height="910" /> <em>Ha Long Bay cruise is an awesome way to explore the numerous islands of this beautiful bay! Other than this, there are numerous ferries that sail to other islands.</em></div>
Vietnam has numerous beautiful islands along its <strong>3,260 kilometer-long coastline</strong>. Ha Long Bay alone has <strong>1,600 limestone islands!</strong> You can take a boat tour around Ha Long Bay which is one of the most enjoyable trips in Vietnam!
<div class="single_post_info_box"><i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle fa-2x"></i> These tours tend to be really crowded, so plan ahead to avoid huge tourist crowds!</div>
To connect the mainland with the islands, there are <strong>numerous scheduled ferries</strong> to keep you covered. Some schedules will depend on the <strong>weather conditions</strong> though, don’t expect to take a ferry ride during a storm! They sail <strong>through the whole year</strong> to the major islands off the coastline of Vietnam.

The available ferry routes are:

<strong>Northern Vietnam</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Ferry and hydrofoil services that run from <strong>Hai Phong to Cat Ba</strong></li>
 	<li>Ferry services that run from <strong>Ha Long to Quan Lan</strong></li>
 	<li>Hydrofoil services that run from <strong>Ha Long to Mong Cai and Bai Tu Long</strong></li>
 	<li>Ferry services that run from <strong>Cai Rong to Quan Lan</strong></li>
 	<li>Ferry services that run from <strong>Cai Rong to Co To</strong></li>
 	<li>Ferry services that run from <strong>Tuan Chau to Cat Ba</strong></li>
</ul>
<strong>Central Vietnam</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Ferry services that run from <strong>Hoi An to Cham Islands</strong></li>
 	<li>Ferry services that run from <strong>Quang Ngai to Ly Son</strong></li>
</ul>
<strong>Southern Vietnam</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Ferry services that run from <strong>Ha Tien to Phu Quoc</strong></li>
 	<li>Ferry services that run from <strong>Rach Gia to Phu Quoc</strong></li>
 	<li>Ferry services that run from <strong>Rach Gia to Nam Du Island</strong></li>
 	<li>Hydrofoil services that run from <strong>Saigon to Vung Tau</strong></li>
 	<li>Ferry services that run from <strong>Soc Trang to Con Dao</strong></li>
 	<li>Ferry services that run from <strong>Chau Doc to Phnom Penh</strong> (this ferry crosses the Cambodian border)</li>
</ul>
Other than ferry and hydrofoil services, you can also take the <strong>river ferries</strong>. They are gradually being replaced by bridges though. There are still a few river ferries that haul themselves from bank to bank of the <strong>numerous strands of the Mekong river</strong>. You can book them from morning till night!

All of these tickets can be bought via <a href="https://www.baolau.com/"><strong>Baolau app</strong></a> too!

So, if you’re up for some island hopping or a Mekong river cruise, you are covered on that front too!
<h2><strong>Want to experience the chaotic roads of Vietnam? Rent a car or a jeep then!</strong></h2>
<div class="image_description"><img class="size-full wp-image-4060" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.rent-a-car-vietnam.jpg" alt="You can rent a car in Vietnam, but you will also need to hire a driver." width="960" height="540" /> <em>You can rent a car in Vietnam, but you will also need to hire a driver.</em></div>
These days, <strong>cars get more and more popular</strong> for transportation in Vietnam. It is really no wonder; they are a <strong>convenient, flexible and independent</strong> means of transport!

The main disadvantage would be the <strong>high cost of renting</strong> though. Another one of the main downsides to renting a car is that foreign visitors (or other short-term visitors) still <strong>aren’t allowed to drive a car for themselves!</strong>

Renting a car, jeep or a minibus with a driver from same agencies, companies and tourist offices that arrange tours is literally effortless! This is quite an <strong>economical means of transport</strong> if you are traveling in a group. That also means that you can <strong>plan a trip based upon your own taste</strong>, instead of following an itinerary of a tour company.

The prices for car rentals <strong>vary wildly</strong>, so it really pays off to research! Expect to pay:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>$50+/day</strong> for a car</li>
 	<li><strong>$90+/day</strong> for a jeep</li>
</ul>
<div class="single_post_info_box"><i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle fa-2x"></i> Of course, the prices will depend on the size of the vehicle, its age and comfort level.</div>
The payment for the car or jeep rentals is often <strong>made in cash directly</strong> to agencies. Vehicles that are the most common are<strong> 4-seated and 7-seated</strong>.

When you negotiate the price, it is important to <strong>clarify who will be responsible for what</strong>. Some things to check are:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Who will pay for the drivers’ accommodation and meals?</strong></li>
 	<li><strong>Who will pay for the fuel, road and ferry tolls and parking fees?</strong> (clients are mostly responsible for the fuel costs!)</li>
 	<li><strong>Who will pay for the repairs and what will happen in the case of a major breakdown?</strong></li>
</ul>
After negotiating the rental price, you should <strong>make a temporary contract</strong> that will show all the above details. Also, this contract should <strong>include the agreed itinerary</strong>, especially if you are renting a vehicle for more than a day!
<div class="single_post_info_box"><i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle fa-2x"></i> Make sure that the driver gets a copy of the contract in Vietnamese!</div>
In some cases, you will need to agree on the rental price in advance. If possible, it is best if you are able to <strong>arrange to</strong> <strong>pay roughly half of the amount before and the other half after your journey.</strong>

There are also some <strong>things to look out for before renting a car or a jeep in Vietnam</strong>:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Make sure to check the quality of the car!</strong> Rental cars are often used by unprofessional drivers who do not care for their vehicle at all. That way, you will avoid unnecessary dramas, breakdowns, and accidents. Do not hesitate to spend more time in agencies to find the car that fits your demand most ideally!</li>
 	<li><strong>Consider the traffic in Vietnam!</strong> Driving a car in the heavy traffic of Vietnam is really challenging, especially in the cities - there is a flood of motorbikes on every side! Of course, the local drivers are familiar with this situation, and most of them will be confident with driving in these situations.</li>
</ul>
That’s all that you need about renting a car or a jeep in Vietnam. It is a <strong>flexible means of transport</strong> in Vietnam that can be an excellent experience for sure!

So now, we have covered all the public means of transport in Vietnam when it comes to overcoming larger distances.

Most travelers will want to stay in some larger cities as they are really attractive and have plenty of things to do. Some of the travelers <strong>aren’t confident enough to rent or buy a motorbike</strong> and enter into the chaotic traffic of Vietnam yet.

<em>If you're confident enough, check out our <a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/buy-motorbike-in-vietnam"><strong>guidelines on how to buy a reliable motorbike in Vietnam</strong></a>!</em>

Thankfully, there are more than enough local transport services, and we will be covering them shortly!
<h2><strong>Are you staying in the city for a while? There is a lot of local transportation means for you to try!</strong></h2>
<div class="image_description"><img class="wp-image-4061 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.local-transportation-vietnam.jpg" alt="There are numerous diverse means of local transportation in Vietnam." width="4416" height="3312" /> <em>There are numerous diverse means of local transportation in Vietnam.</em></div>
It isn’t that surprising to see <strong>diverse types of local transport</strong> in a country with a population that is so creative with limited resources.

Taxis are increasingly getting more common each day, and a number of cities have reasonable bus services. Somewhere else, you will have to rely on two and three-wheeled vehicles for getting around. Also, the metro system in Hanoi and Saigon will be soon open for public, which will most definitely be the next means of public transportation in Vietnam.

So, here are some of the <strong>most common local transportation services</strong> in the cities of Vietnam!
<h3><strong>Local buses in Hanoi</strong></h3>
<div class="image_description"><img class="size-full wp-image-4063" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.hanoi-bus.jpg" alt="Boarding a local bus in Hanoi is a cheap way to get around main points in Hanoi." width="2000" height="1333" /> <em>Boarding a local bus in Hanoi is a cheap way to get around main points in Hanoi.</em></div>
In Hanoi, you can spot the local buses by their <strong>red, yellow and white</strong> colors. The prices and standards vary, the rates are usually from <strong>5k to 10k VND </strong>(<strong>from 22 cents to 43 cents</strong>). You must pay the fares in cash!
<div class="single_post_info_box"><i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle fa-2x"></i> Try to negotiate on a price and have the exact money ready before boarding as fare collectors tend to take advantage of your ignorant position.</div>
Boarding the local buses is a <strong>great way to practice your Vietnamese language skills</strong> that will come in handy for haggling.

The main bus route is called <strong>BRT</strong> (an acronym for Bus Rapid Transit). It is the first rapid transit bus system in Hanoi that opened at the end of 2016. The BRT <strong>connects Kim Ma and Yen Nghia</strong>, which are the most populated areas of Hanoi. There are <strong>eight BRT routes</strong> planned to be in function till 2030!
<div class="single_post_info_box"><i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle fa-2x"></i> These buses may be uncomfortable for Western standards, as their design is for generally smaller Vietnamese people.</div>
Buses also come in handy when trying to <strong>get somewhere in Hanoi from the airport</strong>. There are several bus routes to take.

You can catch <strong>bus number 7</strong> from Noi Bai International Airport that you can ride to Kim Ma Station. There is also the <strong>number 17 bus</strong> that goes to the Long Bien Station. The tickets cost <strong>5k VND </strong>(<strong>around 22 cents</strong>), and it will take an hour to get to the city center on these buses.

There is also a new bus, <strong>number 86</strong>. It is comfortable and has Wi-Fi. This bus <strong>connects directly to the central Hanoi railway station</strong> that is in Le Duan Street. The price of the ride is <strong>31k VND </strong>(<strong>around $1,3</strong>).

There are also mini buses that will take you <strong>from the airport to the city center or directly to your accommodation</strong>. Their prices range from <strong>32k to 64k VND </strong>(<strong>from $1,38 to $2,75</strong>) and will depart once they are full.

Vietnam Airlines organize these minibuses, and the end station is their office in the Quang Trung Street that is located on the south of Hoan Kiem Lake.
<h3><strong>Local buses in Saigon</strong></h3>
<div class="image_description"><img class="size-full wp-image-4064" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.saigon-bus.jpg" alt="The local bus in Saigon is easily spotted by its white and green color." width="2000" height="1333" /> <em>The local bus in Saigon is easily spotted by its white and green color.</em></div>
You can spot the local buses in Saigon by their <strong>white and green color</strong>. The prices and standards of these buses vary. Expect to pay anywhere between <strong>3k and 10k VND</strong> (<strong>around 13 cents to 43 cents</strong>) in cash for a ticket.

The same thing as with local buses in Hanoi; <strong>try to negotiate a price and have the exact money ready</strong> before boarding to avoid the fare collectors taking advantage of your ignorant position.

These buses <strong>may not be the most comfortable</strong> for Western standards, but they serve as a suitable means of local transport.

There are also buses that can take you <strong>from Saigon airport to your desired location</strong>.

If arriving before 6 AM and 6 PM, take the <strong>bus 152</strong>; the bus stop is directly outside the international terminal.

Take <strong>bus 109</strong> if you want a more luxurious journey. It departs from Column 15 at the international terminal and Column 18 from the domestic terminal.
<h3><strong>Xe Om (motorbike taxis)</strong></h3>
<div class="image_description"><img class="size-full wp-image-4065" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.motorbike-taxi-vietnam.jpg" alt="Motorbike taxi is the most common type of local transport in Vietnam." width="1636" height="920" /> <em>Motorbike taxi is the most common type of local transport in Vietnam.</em></div>
As motorbikes are flooding the cities of Vietnam like flies, it is not surprising that motorbike taxis are the <strong>most common means of local transport</strong>.

You will rarely be able to walk even twenty meters without being offered a ride in larger cities.
<div class="single_post_info_box"><i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle fa-2x"></i> Most of the Xe Om drivers hang around corners of the street, hotels, markets and bus stations.</div>
<strong>You don’t need to actively search for them</strong>, as they will most likely approach you at some point, especially if you give out non-verbal cues!
<div class="single_post_info_box"><i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle fa-2x"></i> The motorbike taxi prices will go up after dark, and there is a possibility of extortion too! David and Lovel have been actually offered drugs and hookers from one motorbike taxi driver on a motorbike taxi in Hanoi!</div>
Remember that the <strong>rules of bargaining in Vietnam</strong> apply at all times when trying to book the Xe Om:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Use finger gestures</strong> to indicate numbers which in turn indicate the price with a higher number of zeroes or in dollars!</li>
 	<li>Keep in mind if you are <strong>negotiating for a single or return trip</strong>, and for a number of passengers too!</li>
 	<li>If you <strong>write these figures down</strong>, you can show the exact fare to the hand of an argumentative driver!</li>
</ul>
The motorbike taxis have almost replaced the quintessential means of local transport in Vietnam - the cyclo.
<h3><strong>Cyclo</strong></h3>
<div class="image_description"><img class="size-full wp-image-4066" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.cyclo-vietnam.jpg" alt="Cyclo is an ideal type of local transportation to just cruise around the cities of Vietnam." width="1024" height="683" /> <em>Cyclo is an ideal type of local transportation to just cruise around the cities of Vietnam.</em></div>
The cyclo is most definitely one of the <strong>most favorite methods of transportation</strong> <strong>among international tourists</strong> visiting Vietnam. It is <strong>very relaxing to just cruise around</strong> the chaotic Vietnamese traffic slowly!

The cyclo is an <strong>environment-friendly</strong> means of transport that is slowly dying out. These three-wheeled rickshaws consist of a “bucket” seat that is attached to a front of a bicycle, hence their iconic name.

They can <strong>carry one person, or even two</strong>, even though it requires a push, so it is just better to go on foot!

You can find cyclos <strong>around markets or hotels</strong>, mostly in groups. Mostly, you can find them in touristy areas such as <strong>Hoi An, Hue and the Old Quarter in Hanoi</strong>.

The cyclo ride <strong>prices vary based on an area</strong>. Expect to pay approximately:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>10k to 20k VND </strong>(<strong>43 cents to 86 cents</strong>) for a short ride</li>
 	<li><strong>20k to 40k VND</strong> (<strong>86 cents to $1,72</strong>) for a longer or a night ride</li>
</ul>
The general rate is <strong>40k VND for an hour </strong>(<strong>$1,72</strong>).

There are various stories of <strong>cyclo riders charging enormous sums for their service</strong> or leaving passengers somewhere random and asking for a considerable amount of money in return. Aside from these, there are also <strong>stories of</strong> <strong>people being mugged by cyclo riders</strong> in Saigon during the night. It is safer to <strong>ride cyclos during the day!</strong>
<div class="single_post_info_box"><i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle fa-2x"></i> If you want to avoid being ripped off by cyclo riders, find out what is a reasonable fare from your local accommodation. If the first driver won’t accept your offer, walk away and find another one - bargaining is absolutely necessary!</div>
Good thing to know is that most of the cyclo drivers <strong>speak basic English</strong> as they mostly target international tourists. If you want them to know where you want to go, <strong>prepare a digital or physical map</strong>, just in case!
<h3><strong>Taxi</strong></h3>
<div class="image_description"><img class="size-full wp-image-4067" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.taxi-vietnam.jpg" alt="When choosing taxi services in Vietnam, make sure to pick the reputable companies, such as Mai Linh." width="838" height="448" /> <em>When choosing taxi services in Vietnam, make sure to pick the reputable companies, such as Mai Linh.</em></div>
Taxis are a <strong>common sight on the streets</strong> of all major cities in Vietnam. Most of them have <strong>taxi meters with prices in Dongs</strong>, and the fares are not that expensive. The average tariffs go from <strong>10k to 15k VND per kilometer </strong>(<strong>43 cents to 65 cents per kilometer</strong>).

The taxi <strong>standards have been improving</strong> in recent years as there is greater competition every day. There are some <strong>scams to look out for</strong> though:
<ul>
 	<li>Some drivers may still <strong>need a</strong> <strong>bit of persuasion</strong> to use their meters.</li>
 	<li>Some drivers will <strong>go along the longer route</strong> to fill up the meter.</li>
 	<li>Some drivers will just <strong>cruise around while the meter will be spinning suspiciously fast</strong> - these guys are the <strong>most common in Hanoi and Saigon</strong> and around bus terminals.</li>
 	<li>When you are arriving in town, <strong>beware of drivers who will insist that the hotel you ask for is closed</strong> and want to take you somewhere else - this is usually a commission scam that often happens when you book a taxi from an airport.</li>
</ul>
<em>Read our <a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/scams-in-vietnam"><strong>comprehensive post on scams in Vietnam</strong></a> to get yourself prepared!</em>

We can divide taxis into two types: <strong>official and unofficial</strong>.

Official taxi companies offer <strong>high-quality services for reasonable prices</strong> that are closer to the mentioned common tariff of 10k to 15k VND per kilometer.

Individual drivers usually drive unofficial taxis. They won’t offer the best quality of service and will mostly use <strong>unreliable and vague</strong> means of calculating fees. Generally, they are <strong>not verified to be a safe option</strong>.

Look for those taxis that look more “smart”. Those that <strong>wait outside big hotels</strong> tend to be more reliable than others. <strong>Mai Linh Taxi Network</strong> has the best reputation by far. You will see their green cabs all across Vietnam.
<h3><strong>Local transportation apps</strong></h3>
<div class="image_description"><img class="size-full wp-image-4062" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.grab-vietnam.jpg" alt="You can find Grab drivers everywhere around cities of Vietnam." width="1746" height="1364" /> <em>You can find Grab drivers everywhere around cities of Vietnam.</em></div>
As <strong>mobile internet is very cheap</strong> and widespread in the cities of Vietnam, mobile transportation apps are also a viable means of local transportation!

We would definitely recommend the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.grabtaxi.passenger&amp;hl=en"><strong>Grab app</strong></a>. It is an awesome mobile application that offers regular <strong>taxi and motorbike taxi services</strong>. You can save your credit card info to your account and use the GrabPay system, or pay in cash.

You can book your ride with this application and go to the wanted location by highlighting it on the map. With this app, you can also see where is your desired driver on the map. For this convenient method to function, you will need a <strong>mobile Internet connection</strong>, of course!

<em>Check out <a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/mobile-apps-vietnam"><strong>more useful mobile apps</strong></a> that will come in handy while traveling in Vietnam!</em>

<hr />

So, this is mostly all that you need to know about public transportation in Vietnam. Be it overland travel or local travel, one is certain. Public transportation in Vietnam is <strong>quickly improving</strong> these days in terms of quality and quantity.

If you travel for longer distances; buses, trains, and airplanes are the best options. We opt for buses and trains if you want to see and experience more of the Vietnamese charm. While a flight may be faster, you won’t get amazing views and rich travel experience.

I hope you enjoyed this post, and as always, if you have any questions or something to add to this post, <strong>don’t hesitate to do so in the comment section below!</strong>

Wish you safe travels in Vietnam! :)

		<Content><![CDATA[I was a coffee lover way before traveling to Vietnam, but once I've tried Vietnamese coffee, everything changed. Vietnamese coffee is diverse in texture, taste, and color, and locals enjoy their cup of coffee. It's easy to say that the coffee culture is strong, and everyone can feel it instantly. It would be a sin not to try some of the most popular Vietnam coffee types while exploring the county.

Black coffee or coffee with milk are the most common choices, and you'd enjoy it since people use different beans and ways of preparation. If you want to get fancy, you're lucky as Vietnamese people love to experiment with their coffee.

While living in Vietnam for almost two years, I've got a chance to deeply explore a local coffee culture and try different coffee types. Here are a few coffee delicacies you HAVE to try while in Vietnam.
<h2><b>#1- Cà Phê Sữa (Milk Coffee)</b></h2>
<div class="image_description"><img class="wp-image-6038 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.img_5eb2c6487b19b.jpg" alt="Traditional Vietnamese milk coffee" width="1082" height="806" /> Vietnamese milk coffee on a rainy day by <a href="https://flickr.com/photos/sandraw12/32195950841/in/photolist-6WU7KP-7ebqx2-dN2P9c-dSm76x-5RvMMs-2hT5qJe-2erhpwU-7efjRL-7efeGJ-egb88U-6aiw5K-2ejoQJ7-24J1X5c-2g54uj3-2di1qKo-2h2g8ym-2h2g8oX-7efdmE-bsBX2d-5h7mvj-2gzxCWs-7KNnCt-56Q8br-7efg3C-7e37zp-QWhS9i-2gdwkFk-2g6Msef-egbrxC-4KJm8h-4VA6nL-dB7irM-8F67je-FFVyp-7fWFLX-4VA6nA-7e3ghn-8Q2Pa9-7ESaEd-4g3WRN-6aiBCB-7e3f6M-697gSB-7e7dsG-bmTKJB-V77V-R43EuH-7e73p9-7e3bCD-998kDL">Sandra</a> (Attribution-NonCommercial 2.0 Generic (CC BY-NC 2.0)</div>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Okay, so cà phê sữa (coffee with condensed milk) is everywhere around the country, even in the remote mountainous areas. I had a pretty heart-warming experience while traveling around Kontum. I took a short break from a long drive and found a small cover that looked like a local store. I've ordered a coffee with milk (coffee is a universal world and no matter your language, people will understand), but people didn't have it on the stock. The friendly middle-aged women just smiled and screamed in a warm tone. The next thing I know, a neighbor is coming with a cup of hot milk coffee and bringing it to my table. I love Vietnamese people! :)</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Cà phê sữa is a sweet combination of coffee, condensed milk, and usually a handful of broken ice. When you order this type of coffee, you will most likely get a cup with a 'phin' on top while coffee is still brewing. It takes a few minutes to start drinking, but the whole preparation process is what makes <a href="https://vietnamchronicles.com/vietnamese-coffee-culture">Vietnamese coffee culture</a> so unique. You can relax and watch the busy world around you while enjoying a pleasant coffee aroma and waiting for the black magic. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the brewing process is over, just remove the filter and stir the coffee so the condensed milk will mix with coffee and create a sweet and creamy brown drink.  </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It's a robust and sweet coffee, so sometimes, you'll need to add plenty of ice to dilute the bitterness.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For real coffee lovers who want to experience the coffee taste without the mixture of condensed, cà phê đen (black coffee) is a way to go. I don't like it since I prefer a creamy texture and sweetness that comes with condensed milk.</span>

If you're staying in Vietnam for extended periods, then I can't recommend more getting your own phin set and coffee beans. You can buy delicious coffee beans and filters on every local market. Don't forget to check our guide on <a href="https://vietnamchronicles.com/vietnamese-drip-coffee-guide">making Vietnamese milk coffee</a>.
<h3><b>Where to Drink Milk Coffee</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">I would say there is no specific place for drinking traditional cà phê sữa, as you can find local cafes on every step. Just walk around and look for tiny chairs and tables on the street, load locals playing cards and video games - that's the place you're looking for.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The taste differs, depending on the beans and quantity of coffee used, but for first-timers, you will be totally blown away! Antonio is an</span><a href="https://vietnamchronicles.com/living-in-da-nang"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">expat in Da Nang</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, so he knows explicitly a few places where he drinks his coffee! People swear in the quality of Trung Nguyen beans that you get in the big coffee shops and franchises. In some places, especially Da Lat or Buon Ma Thuot, you should support locals and taste the coffee made from organic coffee farms. Plus, this area is known for Arabica coffee, which is rare in Vietnam. </span>
<h2><b>#2- Cà phê trứng (Egg Coffee)</b></h2>
<div class="image_description"><img class="wp-image-6039 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.img_5eb2c6ab24ac9.jpg" alt="Vietnamese egg coffee" width="1438" height="792" /> Egg Coffee in Hanoi by <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/dgmckelvey/6923068614/">David McKelvey</a> - Attribution 2.0 Generic (CC BY 2.0)</div>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Egg coffee is a favorite beverage in the northern part of Vietnam, especially in Hanoi. But don't worry as you can find it everywhere around the country (a bit harder though).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The story of egg coffee shows the ability of Vietnamese people to adapt to ANY situation. During the French war and colonial era, Vietnam lacked many resources since the colonialists were extracting the resources mainly for selling and making the profit for their benefit. In 1946, there was a shortage of milk, so people couldn't enjoy their milk coffee, so they needed to think about the ways to enjoy their favorite drink.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In every tough situation, there is a huge possibility that a great idea will see the light of a day. A guy named</span><a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/pgx4xg/the-man-behind-hanois-original-egg-coffee-is-a-kung-fu-master-of-caffeine"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Tri Hoa Nguyen invented an egg coffee</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> where he used an egg blend instead of milk. Egg coffee wasn't famous until the 80s when Vietnam started to invest heavily in the coffee industry. During the 80s, the egg coffee popularity went through the roof, and Vietnam, once again, was recognized as an innovative country. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to taste, some people love it, some people hate it. It depends on your taste, so we're going to leave it for you to judge.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The egg coffee is made with a fresh and raw egg yolk mixed with condensed milk. It is more of a dessert than a drink, and people enjoy it either hot or cold. We prefer it hot since it gives you a fantastic experience when it comes to taste and smell. </span>
<h3><b>Where to Drink Egg Coffee</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Since egg coffee originates from the north, you can find your fix in many local places around Hanoi. Arguably, the most popular place for traditional egg coffee is</span><a href="https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/hanoi-egg-coffee-ca-phe-trung/index.html"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Cafe Giang</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, as this delicious drink originates from there. We didn't have a chance to drink a lot of egg coffee (milk coffee addicts here), but we know for sure that you can find your fix in a famous Cong Cafe around the country.</span>
<h2><b>#3- Bạc xỉu</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Bạc xỉu is a trendy drink around Vietnam that uses the same ingredients as regular milk coffee, but proportions differ. Bạc xỉu is a sugar bomb with a lot of condensed milk mixed with just a bit of coffee and ice. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you're a coffee-lover, then you will probably skip this drink since it doesn't give you a coffee experience, and it's very sweet, but again, it depends on your taste. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Kids or teenagers usually enjoy bạc xỉu who're at cafe shops with their family or people who can't stand a bitterness of traditional Vietnamese coffee. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">During the colonial era, milk was scarce and expensive, but the people around the country still enjoyed it. Higher status people were able to drink condensed milk, but since it was expensive, they needed to mix it with something. They started to mix milk with the water, but the flavor wasn't pleasant, so people began to add a bit of coffee, and they liked it. It's how bạc xỉu was born!</span>
<h3><b>Where to Drink Bac Xiu</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The same goes as for milk coffee - you can find Bac Xiu on every step! Wherever you see a place that sells regular milk coffee, it means you can order Bac Xiu too! If they don't have it on the menu, don't forget to ask for the price in front since people sometimes charge more for the things they don't have on the menu (completely understandable).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The prices in the street shops range between 10k - 20k VND, while in the fine cafes, you can expect to pay up to 50k VND. </span>
<h2><b>#4- Cà phê dừa (Coconut Coffee) </b></h2>
<p id="FmGXPpK"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6040 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.img_5eb2c7717ab2f.jpg" alt="Delicious coconut coffee" width="1164" height="773" /></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">A coconut coffee is a real deal when it comes to coffee and flavor. This type of coffee is very sweet, and it leaves a pleasant coconut taste in your mouth. Vietnamese people usually mix coconut ice cream, a bit of condensed milk, and the potent brew of Vietnamese dark coffee. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you mix it, you get a flawless combination that is called a coconut coffee. It's not a very usual coffee choice among locals, but travelers in general love this type of coffee. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Basically, you're scoping the coconut ice cream with a bit of coffee taste while drinking a strong Vietnamese coffee. How to beat that? </span>
<h3><b>Where to Drink Coconut Coffee</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Like we already mentioned, coconut coffee isn't a favorite drink among locals, so you may face a tough time finding it. Although many fancy (read foreigner-friendly) cafes list coconut coffee on their menus! You will have a hard mission if you're planning to find that drink in the street shops. We didn't specifically look for coconut coffee around the streets, but we've never seen anyone drinking it on the street.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This type of coffee is a bit more expensive than the other types, but still, you can enjoy this tasty drink for 25k - 50k VND in cozy cafes. </span>
<h2><b>#5- Cà phê sữa chua (Yogurt Coffee) </b></h2>
<p id="gumWjrq"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6042 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.img_5eb2c8a478599.jpg" alt="Yogurt coffee" width="517" height="772" /></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Cà phê sữa chua is another coffee specialty, especially during the hot months. Vietnamese people are very adjustable by nature, and that's how they invented a yogurt coffee. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yogurt serves as a balanced source of nutrients and helps in</span><a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/7-benefits-of-yogurt"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">maintaining healthy body functions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> like promoting the immune system, healthy heart, improve digestion, and much more. So they figured out they can mix it with their coffee and make a fantastic drink, because why not!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Its taste reminds of traditional milk coffee, but they add a bit of coconut milk and yogurt in the blend. Also, during the hot months, people add a ton of ice, which makes it crazy addictive and refreshing!</span>
<h3><b>Where to Drink Yogurt Coffee</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">It's hard to find this type of coffee around the streets, but many cafes have it on the menu. Also, during the hot months, you can enjoy this drink on the beach while chilling on the summer breeze. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The price usually starts from 25k in cafes and around 40k on the beach.</span>

		<Content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">So, you’ve already booked your flight and have an idea of destinations to visit and things you’re going to do in Vietnam. You’ve decided that you’re going to travel around Vietnam by motorbike and go into a full adventure mode.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We made the same decision, bought three motorbikes in Hanoi and traveled all the way south to Saigon in 30 days. That was a unique and bonding experience between three brothers, three best friends. It’s impossible that either of us will forget these beautiful and challenging days on the road, breathtaking views we’ve encountered, how much we learned about the culture and everything in between. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>Like my favorite musician put this in words - 'Every little thing is gonna be alright!'.</em> </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">After driving for <strong>more than 25,000 kilometers around the country in total (including Laos too)</strong>, here's the list of 50 things, tricks and tips that will be extremely helpful while traveling around Vietnam by motorbike.</span>
<h2><b>#1- Organized Chaos is Waiting for You!</b></h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4767" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.chaotic-traffic.jpg" alt="A peek to a chaotic traffic" width="4160" height="2340">

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It was around 10 am when I first set my feet in foggy Hanoi. I was at the airport and just arrived from Croatia. At that time, it was the middle of the winter there and I was so lazy, or ignorant, to do any prior research on weather in Hanoi. The first impression was, shiet, I don’t have the right clothes as my suitcase was packed with winter clothes. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Anyway, I figured that out by wearing undersized clothes around Vietnam, but that’s the story for another time. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The first things I’ve noticed while getting out of the airport is the density of traffic. Around the airport, it was still bearable, but as soon as we approached the city center, traffic turned into hell faster than a blink of the eye. </span>
<blockquote>
<h3><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vietnam has a rough population of 90 million people while there are about 45 million registered motorbikes! And yeah, we didn’t mention unregistered or self-made vehicles or even cars/buses/trucks. </span></em></h3>
</blockquote>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Putting all of that into the account, we can conclude that almost every person in Vietnam operates a vehicle! Crazy right?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the cities, motorbikes flock from every possible angle giving you millions of different sounds trying to communicate they are in the traffic. Some drivers drive on sidewalks, some trying to pull out some superhero moves, while others just transport their whole house with family on the motorbike.</span>

If you're looking to get more information about routes, budget, places to visit and more, head over to our detailed article where we talked about our <a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/hanoi-to-saigon"><strong>Hanoi to Saigon motorbike trip</strong></a>.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s an enjoyable experience to sit back and watch traffic passing by, but not so pleasant when you’re aware you’re going to be the part of that chaos soon. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t let these first scenes to discourage you as it looks very shocking and surprising for the outsider, but as soon as you start driving and get a bit comfortable in traffic, you will realize that there is an invisible flow in the traffic everyone is following. </span>
<h2><b>#2- Be Careful About Animals in Traffic</b></h2>
<p id="pBnAPts"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4787 " src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.img_5cfdf198d853f.jpg" alt=""></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In Vietnam, a motorbike is the most common vehicle since it’s affordable and it can serve well for locals to transport things, usually too many things, but it’s working. There are some speeding cars, buses and truck that are racing all the time and seem like they don’t care about anyone in traffic. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s astonishing how not only vehicle operates in traffic, but also flocks of cows, angry dogs, lazy cats, buffalos and many other animals. Be extra careful when driving through small towns or villages in the countryside since dogs can run across the street puts you in a very uncomfortable situation. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Always slow down when you see an animal in traffic since they are unpredictable and can cause accidents. We were talking with many travelers who experienced accidents because of the unpredictable animal in the traffic!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Be extra aware of dogs in cities. Owners usually let them off the leash and they aren’t used to traffic. Dogs or cats typically run across the street without any concern. We saw countless crashes, many dead dogs and scratches on people partly because of (poor) animals in the towns/cities. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t speed in the cities as you never know what’s around the next corner. </span>
<h2><b>#3- You Can’t Overuse the Honk</b></h2>
<p id="KleGwuY"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4788 " src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.img_5cfdf1f1cc672.jpg" alt=""></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t be scared to push that honk button more often than needed! We’re coming from Croatia where honking is considered rude and offensive, so we’re using that button only when we need to release our anger and others.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In Vietnam, the story with honking is totally different since people are real artists using the honk. Some got to the point of composing beautiful melodies while passing you on the road. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We also had our own melodies on honks! It’s a thing you have to do - compose a few melodies regarding the situation!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Anyway, using honk in Vietnam is a very essential part of a daily routine in traffic since there are literally millions of bikes in traffic each second. Nothing is going by the rules and people will pass you from different angles and sides so honking is just a reminder that someone is there. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Its purpose is signaling people 'Hey I’m here!'. </span>
<blockquote>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>Don’t worry - it’s never too much of honking. Also, you can let your frustrations out without offending anyone! So use that honk button!</em> </span></h3>
</blockquote>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve got in two crashes during my time on the road in Vietnam - one was nothing serious, while other was including another local person. Both time, it happened because I didn’t use honk! </span>
<h2><b>#4- Have Glasses for a Night Drive</b></h2>
<p id="kADLfIZ"><img class="alignnone wp-image-4815 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.img_5d0093e57923b.jpg" alt="Overlooking Hai Van Pass from Da Nang" width="1237" height="729"></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Glasses can be beneficial while driving, especially during the night drives around the countryside. The roads are dusty and when any vehicle drives on the street, the dust is getting to the air causing all the particles ending up in your eyes. To prevent that, we suggest buying a full-face helmet or wearing sunglasses during the day and regular glasses during night drives.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Having a pair of glasses can help a lot since it will improve your visibility and protect your eyes from dust (and who knows what else can end up in your eyes?). </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, driving around the countryside during the rice harvest season is the pain in the ass, especially during the night drive. The reason is mighty flies; or better said, the rain of the flies. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">At some points, there are so many flies that makes driving hard and painful (without any kidding!).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Without glasses, it can be very very hard to continue your drive so think in investing some money in glasses or a good full-face helmet.</span>

Non-dioptry glasses in Vietnam are very cheap and you can get one for as low as 300,000 VND.
<h2><b>#5- Avoid Night Drive By All Cost</b></h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4776" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.night-drive.jpg" alt="Avoid night driving" width="4608" height="3456">

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Driving through the night can be very slow and dangerous since the visibility is scarce. The fascinating thing about Vietnamese roads is that they lack the light network. When driving through the countryside, it’s scarce that you’re going to stumble upon some working lights on the road, maybe around the town center, the lights pop up here and there.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When driving on the highway, you'll stumble on tiny patches of light through small towns. Time your trip and try to avoid night drives as much as possible. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">One traveler had the accident while driving during the night on a highway crossing over the massive rock that was literally lying on the middle of the road. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We drove during the night some parts of our routes since we would always start our journey a bit later than expected (not early risers here), which makes our trip a bit slower and more dangerous, but luckily, nothing bad happened. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Were there any close calls? Too many, but luck is on the side of crazy people!</span>
<h2><b>#6- Don’t Forget Your Raincoat</b></h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4779" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.raincoat-is-the-most-important.jpg" alt="Don't forget a raincoat" width="4608" height="3456">

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Never drive without a raincoat below your seat or next to your hands. The weather is very unpredictable, so even if it’s sunny one minute, the next minute you can experience a colossal rain pouring from the sky. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s very funny how people handle the rain as nothing happens. When it starts to rain, people just park their bikes for a second, put the raincoat on, and continue as nothing happens. It’s very amazing!</span>
<blockquote>
<h3><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">We bought our raincoats at Big C supermarket for around 250,000 VND. After 10 months, we’re still using the same raincoats.</span></em></h3>
</blockquote>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the beginning, driving through the rain can be very frustrating since the visibility and road conditions are bad, but after a while, you’ll get used to it. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember, in case you’re frustrated, just use that honk button on your left handle and everything is going to be alright! </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t be cheap and invest in a good quality raincoat as it will save you much hustle while driving. We advise you to get your hands on double part raincoat specially designed for the bikers. You can buy one in the supermarkets.</span>
<h2><b>#7- Mechanics Are Everywhere!</b></h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4774" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.mechanics-everywhere.jpg" alt="Mechanics are everywhere!" width="4608" height="3456">

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There is an inevitable chance that you’re going to buy a motorbike that has many cross-country trips under the milage. Add to that low-quality parts, the lack of maintenance and you have the perfect equation that results with an unexpected breakdown, preferably in the middle of nowhere!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It is so interesting, but almost every breakdown we experienced was in the middle of nowhere. Luckily, friendly people always jump in and help! Mechanics are just everywhere!</span>
<blockquote>
<h3><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just look for signs 'Xe May' or 'Hon Da' which represents a mechanic shop.</span></em></h3>
</blockquote>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t worry though as you'll find local mechanics shops on every step, even in the most remote places. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a possibility that you’re going to put your physical strength in work since the pushing of the bike is proper training, but not for a long.</span>
<h2><b>#8- Don’t Rely Much On Google Maps</b></h2>
<p id="rQRxGQO"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4789 " src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.img_5cfdf24f121a0.jpg" alt=""></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Google Maps is a useful app to have, but always have a backup plan since the maps and navigation aren’t the most accurate thing ever. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">From our experience, we can say that Google Maps works like a charm when you’re traveling between the cities or places, but you want to go to a specific place in a city, the app tends to freak out. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For navigating around specific locations we found out that Maps.me works so much better and you can use it offline after you download a certain map (whole country's maps available).</span>

<strong>Learn more:&nbsp;</strong><strong><a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/mobile-apps-vietnam">Helpful Mobile Apps For Traveling Around Vietnam</a></strong>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Always have both apps installed on your phone in case you get lost or cannot find the location you’re looking for. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Asking people on the road about the specific location doesn’t help since the language barrier is real. We lost so much time figuring out the location once our hope disappeared together with the map. </span>
<h2><b>#10- Don’t Put All of the Money in the Wallet</b></h2>
<p id="CgfySDu"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4799 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.img_5cfdf65810f48.jpg" alt="Vietnamese dong" width="647" height="676"></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Never have all of your cash in one place when driving (good general advice!).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">First, it can be horrible if you lose your wallet as you instantly need to deal with the loss of your money and possibly some documents. Second, traffic police is known to be on a corruption side (especially the countryside) and they won’t mind asking anyone for coffee money.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If the police stop you, the last thing you want to have is the wallet full of money! These guys are seriously greedy.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead, buy another wallet and put some money in. Preferably break down large banknotes into smaller ones. If you ever got caught by the police and they really want a 'tip' from you, always remember to bargain and offer them 'all you have' in the wallet you have on you, while the main wallet is on the safe place! </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Usual coffee price for a police officer is around 200,000 VND. Don't forget to read our article about the <a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/scams-in-vietnam"><strong>most common scams in Vietnam</strong></a>.</span>
<h2><b>#11- Hey! What About a Driving License?</b></h2>
<p id="dTVWfud"><img class="alignnone wp-image-4800 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.img_5cfdf69405cd9.jpg" alt="If you travel Vietnam by motorbike you can expect views like this one!" width="1170" height="864"></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to driving license, Vietnam is a very tricky country that always changes the laws and policies regarding international travelers operating vehicles in the traffic. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Travelers from certain countries can legally operate a vehicle on Vietnamese roads with an international driver’s license, while for some countries, it’s required to have a local driver’s license. Head over to <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Driving_Permit#1968_convention_(original)">Convention 1968</a></strong> to see if your country is on the list.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a bit tricky, but not that complicated. Head over a complete article about getting a <strong><a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/vietnamese-driving-license">Vietnamese driving license</a></strong> and you’ll get the clear understanding which documents you have to go to be a legal driver in the country.</span>
<blockquote>
<h3><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh not to forget! Your insurance won’t cover anything if you have an accident while operating a vehicle without a proper license. So keep that in mind!</span></em></h3>
</blockquote>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">To obtain a local driver’s license, you have to have an IDP with a proper category (usually A) to operate a motorbike. Getting a Vietnamese driver’s license is not hard since it requires only translation if you have a proper permit, but if you don’t have, then you have to pass a theory or riding test which makes it a bit more complicated since you need to know a language and have documents in Vietnam.</span>
<h2><b>#12- Avoid QL1 (National Highway) Whenever You Can</b></h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4764" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.avoid-highway.jpg" alt="Traffic on highways can be extremely dangerous" width="4608" height="3456">

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A notorious Highway 1 (QL1) gets its reputation as one of the deadliest roads in Vietnam since the majority of fatal accidents tend to happen on that road. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The road connects Hanoi to Saigon, so it’s the usual route of huge trucks and buses. The road itself doesn’t provide you with unique scenery except tiny towns located on the skirts of the road that radiate with the local vibe. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s really common for travelers that they take Highway 1 once during their trip, so stopping at small towns is a fantastic way to experience local culture and refresh yourself for the trip that’s still in front of you. Also, if you’re a lack on time, QL1 will definitely make your journey faster since it’s a highway without many obstacles. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you don’t want to drive with buses and trucks in mind all the time, and also want to experience stunning landscapes Vietnam has to offer, then move inland and drive through iconic Ho Chi Minh Trail next to Laos and Cambodia border.</span>

Thinking of crossing to Laos with your motorbike? Here you can check everything you have to know about <strong><a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/border-crossing-vietnam-laos-motorbike">crossing from Vietnam to Laos by motorbike</a></strong>.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Traffic on Ho Chi Minh Road is very light, the roads are windy offering you a great driving experience while being surrounded by breathtaking nature. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">What more to ask for?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have a very limited time in Vietnam, then Highway 1 will be a faster way to travel between the locations, so it really depends on your situation which road you’re going to take. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have enough time to explore the beauty of the country, we recommend avoiding Highway 1 at all costs and drive inland instead. </span>
<h2><b>#13- Fill a Bottle With a Fuel </b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Having a bottle filled with gas will never hurt you while traveling around the country, especially if you’re taking a Ho Chi Minh Road. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">On the Highway, there are gas stations on every few kilometers, but once you start driving through secluded routes don’t expect the same. The gas stations will become scarce and if you don't properly prepare yourself, you’re going to push your bike a long way. </span>
<blockquote>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>Always put some fuel in an empty bottle to avoid the struggle and hustle as it will serve you as S.O.S. bottle!</em> </span></h3>
</blockquote>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">We were driving from Da Nang to Kon Tum without knowing that on the way there are like 5 gas stations for the route of 300 kilometers through mountainous area featuring crazy and challenging passes. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Can you guess what happened? Yeah, we were pushing bikes for some time during one stormy night around Central Highlands!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t be like us and plan everything in advance! </span>
<h2><b>#14- Don’t Forget to Cover Your Body From Sun (Wear Sunscreen)</b></h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4784" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.wear-sunscreen.jpg" alt="don't forget to apply sunscrean" width="4608" height="3456">

<span style="font-weight: 400;">That one is a no-brainer, but still, you will see many foreigners with minimalistic fashion driving around the country in the middle of the summer. Don’t get us wrong, we were doing the same!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s hilarious and different when you arrive in Vietnam and see how much people care about their skin and how many layers of clothes they put on themselves while driving. As much as it’s funny, it makes total sense as Vietnam is a very hot country with many sunny days in a year. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Always drive with long sleeves and possibly apply sunscreen with a high factor on you! It’s recommended to buy the sunscreen in your home country since it’s costly in Vietnam and you’ll have a hard time to find a skin product without a whitening effect. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We were all very sunburned during our trip and believe us it sucks when you have crazy sunburns but still need to drive the next day. Just keep the care of your skin!</span>
<h2><b>#15- Always Have a Few Days Unplanned</b></h2>
<p id="ZYkYpib"><img class="alignnone wp-image-4811 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.img_5d007bef35f94.jpg" alt="relaxing in Mui Ne" width="998" height="741"></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Before arriving in Vietnam, it’s an excellent thing to have your itinerary and route planned. For us, and many other travelers, it was easy to plan destinations, but the hard task was to plan the exact amount of days we’re going to stay at a certain place. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You never know when a certain place intrigues you and you feel like you need more time to explore. It was almost every place! </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Always have a plan of your route with exact timing, but don’t forget to have few days unplanned as it will give you the flexibility to stay at some locations for a long time without compromising with other locations. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We had 6 days unplanned and it worked like a charm since we stayed in Da Nang and Phan Thiet longer than planned. </span>
<h2><b>#16- Whenever You Need Help Locals Will Jump In&nbsp;</b></h2>
<p id="RBSOUJN"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4790 " src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.img_5cfdf2b6086ff.jpg" alt=""></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Running out of the fuel or getting a flat tire in the middle of nowhere sucks, especially if you travel alone, but don’t worry since you are never alone in this beautiful country. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You will always find a local person who’ll be more than happy to give you a hand or call others to help.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the end, if you experience the same in your country, would you help a foreigner? Of course!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Antonio got pushed many times by locals when he ran out of the gas in the middle of nowhere. They just put their leg on the bike and push which is very unusual and funny but also be careful as it can be very dangerous too. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Vietnam is a country where people will help you without asking anything in return, so uncomfortable situations aren’t such a huge problem here. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Just relax and you’ll be fine!</span>
<h2><b>#17- Basic Phrases Save Lot of Hustle (e.g., have Google Translate with you)!</b></h2>
<p id="jJdDitH"><img class="alignnone wp-image-4814 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.img_5d0093738044b.jpg" alt="Lively food markets in Vietnam" width="1246" height="748"></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Many travelers will share the same advice when it comes to traveling to any country - learn language basics. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In Vietnam, knowing the basic phrases can go a long way since there is a considerable language barrier, especially in remote places. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Even simple phrases like greetings can give you an advantage when it comes to getting a better price for goods. We get an impression that people become friendlier when you greet them with a simple 'Xin Chao' and they become eager to help you even more.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Knowing numbers and food names can help you a lot when it comes to bargaining and ordering in the restaurants. We saved so much time when dealing with mechanics during our trip just by knowing to say a few phrases.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Anyway, if you don’t have a chance or time to learn basics, don’t worry since Google Translate works like a charm for a basic conversation. The translation isn’t the most accurate, but people will get the context...in most cases. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Have in mind that Vietnamese is a vocal language consisting of six different tones which makes it extremely difficult for foreigners properly intonation the words. There are many words with the same spelling, but different intonation and it will give you a completely different meaning. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, as you start to travel around different provinces, the language begins to sound a bit different (dialect). </span>
<h2><b>#18- Don’t Forget to Get a Valid SIM Card </b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">A valid SIM card in Vietnam is a must-have! It’s relatively effortless to get your hands on a valid phone number with 4G ultrafast internet. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We paid 90,000 VND for 1 month of 4gb per day data plan. You don’t need to provide any documents when buying which makes it extremely easy for you to have the card and also, the 4G cover around the country is impressive. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You can experience the lack of signal in the highlands near the borders with Cambodia and Laos, but around the country, we must say we were shocked in a good way about the internet. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Go for Viettel (Vietnamese army is using this provider) or MobiFone. </span>
<h2><b>#19- Be Extra Careful of Buses and Trucks </b></h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4765" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.be-aware-of-trucks.jpg" alt="Be aware of trucks at all time" width="4608" height="3456">

<span style="font-weight: 400;">QL represents a national highway in Vietnam and every QL road consists of three tracks. Two were for big vehicles while the small one is for motorbikes. The motorbike lane is the most right lane on the road and it’s usually in pretty bad condition filled with rocks, a lot of mud, potholes and passing animals.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We were mainly driving on the middle track, but doing so, you put yourself in the risk of encountering racing buses or trucks. &nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Always, remember watching your mirrors! </span>
<blockquote>
<h3><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s an unwritten rule of driving around Vietnam! It’s imperative to know what’s in front of you, but it’s even more important to understand what’s behind you. It’s horrifying when you drive and you’re totally relaxed and at one moment, there is a racing bus behind you starts to honk at you to move!</span></em></h3>
</blockquote>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Whenever you see a bus, truck or a car in your mirror, just politely move a bit on the right side until they pass you. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We had a few close encounters with buses and trucks on the highway because it’s hard to pay attention to your mirrors when you have stunning scenery all around you. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">On smaller roads in the mountains, the traffic isn’t so heavy, so it’s more pleasant and safer to drive. Anyway, be extra careful of what’s going behind your back!</span>
<h2><b>#20- Majority of Roads Sucks</b></h2>
<p id="yMFPWoz"><img class="alignnone wp-image-4791 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.img_5cfdf2f53f6e2.jpg" alt="Offroad around Vietnam" width="1244" height="737"></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Conditions of Vietnamese roads aren’t a thing you will remember with a happy smile on your face. The majority of roads sucks! </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Highway 1 is mostly in good condition, but heavy traffic and dust make it dangerous to drive. Also, we’ve encountered countless rocks and other objects on the road that can make you fall from the bike in a blink of the eye.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Antonio met a few travelers in Nghe An, where he was <strong><a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/starlight-english-center-vietnam">volunteering as a teacher</a></strong>, who had the accident because of the rock on the road. That’s one of the reasons we always emphasize avoiding a night drive. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When you add the weather conditions and wrap it up with road conditions, it makes it very fragile to drive even for experienced drivers.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes you can drive through a mud or oil patch that will make your motorbike unstable; sometimes the foggy or rainy weather will make it extremely hard to drive. It’s primarily related to Hai Van Pass!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Country roads are charming to drive, but you should be careful of the holes along the road. We encountered hundreds of holes that can do serious damage to your bike and you. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Be careful and don’t speed on the roads you’ve never driven before!</span>
<h2><b>#21- Does Anyone in Vietnam Have a Driving License?</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you join the chaotic traffic, you will see many unexplainable things including kids driving the motorbikes. It gives the impression that not many people in Vietnam have a proper driving license.</span>
<blockquote>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>The most dangerous is turning without giving the proper signal or doing U-turns without looking for the upcoming traffic.</em> </span></h3>
</blockquote>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you hit the road, you will experience all kind of crazy things in traffic, especially people not respecting almost any traffic rule which makes the impression not many people hold any driver’s license here. It's not only that you're going to be surprised by people's driving skills, but expect to experience a crazy amount of <a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/culture-shocks-in-vietnam"><strong>culture shocks in Vietnam</strong></a> too.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Be extra careful when you’re driving around Vietnamese roads as you never know what’s the person around you have in mind. </span>
<h2><b>#22- If You Got Pulled Over, Just Speak Another Language Than English </b></h2>
<p id="FnVSUmf"><img class="alignnone wp-image-4792 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.img_5cfdf34b45abe.jpg" alt="Vietnamese traffic police" width="1005" height="662"></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you remember the times your family was telling you that knowing the languages can be a tremendous asset? Well, in Vietnam, knowing English and one language other than English is a huge asset!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’ve ever got pulled over by traffic police, just remember not to speak English. Not many police officers know to speak English, but if they do, they will most likely request a juicy 'tip'.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, if you start speaking a language they don’t understand, after a few moments of hustle, they will realize it’s not worth to spend time on you, so they will probably just let you go since there are millions of other people to stop. We wrote a huge article explaining <strong><a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/vietnamese-police-guide">how to deal with the Vietnamese police</a></strong>&nbsp;where&nbsp;you can get some interesting insights and tips.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if you’re not speaking any language other than English, just invent your own language.</span>
<h2><b>#23- Regular Bike Maintenance</b></h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4777" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.oil-change.jpg" alt="Change oil and do other maintainance regularly" width="4608" height="3456">

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a huge chance that you’re going to drive around Vietnam on a very old motorbike that already passed the country countless times. These bikes need a crazy amount of care and maintenance, especially when driving them long-distance. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">These bikes aren’t made for driving a few hundred kilometers per day and it tears down their engine. It’s of uttermost importance that you track your kilometers and adequately maintain the bike. </span>
<blockquote>
<h3><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don't forget to do regular oil changes every 500 - 1,000 kilometers.</span></em></h3>
</blockquote>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you do an oil change, be sure to tighten the chain and breaks and also lube the chain so your bike will drive smoothly around all kinds of terrains. </span>
<h2><b>#24- Get a Smartphone Holder and USB Charger</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Ah, sweet smartphone holder! It was so easy to navigate once we had a proper phone holder on Antonio’s bike. These holders are very cheap and you can find them anywhere. Just head over a local market or any electronic shop and you can get yours for about 50,000 VND. &nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When we had a phone holder, it was effortless to drive around the country, even in the most remote areas. Without a phone holder, you will lose so much time stopping and checking the map all the time. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There is one story and only Lovel knows what really happened there. We were heading to Mui Ne from Nha Trang and we had a meeting point in Cam Rang. David and I have already met, but there was no Lovel. We called him and he said he drove about 50 kilometers out of Nha Trang, stopped at the gas station and returned back to Nha Trang.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s our warmest recommendation always to have a phone holder on your motorbike! Don't forget to get a bike with a USB charger!</span>
<h2><b>#25- Invest a Bit More in the Bike to Avoid Breakdowns and Delays </b></h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4771" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.invest-in-a-motorbike.jpg" alt="invest a bit more in motorbikes" width="4608" height="3456">

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When buying a bike, don’t be greedy and invest a bit more in the more reliable bike. Driving a cheap bike can be a double-edged sword since you never know what’s the condition of the engine and when and where another breakdown is going to happen.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Breakdowns may be tough hits on your wallet and time and by all costs, you want to avoid them. We changed our plans many times and overstayed in some locations since Antonio had a very bad motorbike and he was the known customer around mechanic shops...</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We advise you to invest in a real Honda or Yamaha bike, a possible semi-automatic that is very reliable, and even it the case of a breakdown, all the mechanics will be able to help you. Read more about our <a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/vietnam-on-a-budget"><strong>motorbike trip budget breakdown</strong></a> to plan your budget accordingly.</span>
<blockquote>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>For instance, Honda Wave is the perfect bike. A genuine Honda costs about $350+, but it won’t give you any struggles during the road trip. Unfortunately, you’ll have a bit harder time to sell your bike quick since it’s a bit on the expensive side.</em> </span></h3>
</blockquote>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">You can read our complete guide on <strong><a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/sell-motorbike-vietnam">selling motorbikes in Vietnam</a></strong> that will provide you with valuable tips and ideas on selling your bike fast and for the same price you bought it. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the end, your cheap bike will cost you probably the same as a bit more reliable bike since you’ll probably get many breakdowns on the way. </span>
<h2><strong>#26- Ask for a Test Ride and Check If Numbers on the Blue Card Matches&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<p id="TZLdPre"><img class="alignnone wp-image-4793 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.img_5cfdf38d645b5.jpg" alt="Vietnam by motorbike - be sure to check your blue card numbers before getting a bike" width="1324" height="698"></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Buying a bike is always a tricky thing, especially if you don’t have any mechanic experience. The motorbike market is enormous, so there are all kinds of bikes in different conditions and many scams are going on.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We wrote a massive and detailed post about buying a motorbike in Vietnam, so be sure to check all the details before getting yourself a motorcycle. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The most important thing or document that comes with your bike and probably give at least half of the value to the bike is a famous blue card. It’s a small document proving that you own the bike. </span>
<blockquote>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>There are two significant numbers on the blue card - a chassis and engine number. Be sure these numbers are visible (not scratched) and matching the number on the blue card.</em> </span></h3>
</blockquote>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If these numbers don’t match, there is a considerable possibility there is something wrong with the bike, or even the bike is stolen. The bike as that loses almost all the market’s value, so always check the numbers! Also, the police will give you a hard time if they check the bikes. They usually don’t do it, especially to foreigners, but better be safe than sorry. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It will take a few minutes from your time to check these numbers, but it will save you many headaches in the future! </span>
<h2><b>#27- Get Travel Insurance!</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Wherever you travel, don’t forget to insure yourself and your belongings as you never know what can happen on the road. The last thing you want to experience is the accident in a foreign country without insurance. It can be very costly, no matter of the country’s standard, so investing in proper travel insurance is the right decision.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Travel insurances are very affordable these days while covering the majority of your belongings and most importantly, your health. Traveling around Vietnam with motorbike really requires travel insurance as the traffic is so unpredictable and one moment you enjoy, the next moment you can experience a crash.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Do the research and compare the most relevant insurance policies that suit you.</span>
<blockquote>
<h3><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember that insurance won’t cover the medical/hospital costs if you were involved in an accident without a proper driver’s license.</span></em></h3>
</blockquote>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">We advise you to check out World Nomads insurance as they also ensure your belongings and technology which comes handy when traveling the long distance in unpredictable weather conditions and chaotic traffic. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">David’s laptop was broken during the ride from Da Nang to Kon Tum since we were driving for 15 hours through a crazy storm. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">His backpack was filled with water and his laptop didn’t give any sign of life. Sadly for David, he didn’t have insurance that covers technology, so all the losses went directly to his wallet and time. Later, we found out his backpack was only water resistant that can't handle being exposed to rain for 15 hours. If you're traveling by motorbike around the country, we suggest to learn what's a <a href="https://www.arcido.com/blogs/news/waterproof-vs-water-resistant">difference between water resistant and waterproof backpack</a>. It will save you a ton of money and headache.</span>
<h2><b>#28- Buy a Bike in Hanoi and Sell in Saigon</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The motorbike market in Vietnam is simply enormous. Keep in mind the fact that there are about 45 millions of registered motorbikes operating in traffic daily.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Majority of travelers will recommend you start your journey in Hanoi since the motorbikes are easier to get there and the prices are bit lower. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The main reason for these price fluctuations is Hanoi’s location. Majority of the motorbikes in Vietnam comes from China or factories there, so logistic costs are lower to bring the bike in Hanoi than Saigon. That results in a slight cheaper bike. For instance, Sufat or Detech Win in Hanoi is on average $50 cheaper than in Saigon. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We bought our bikes in Hanoi and sold them in Saigon without getting more money than we invested. You can’t expect that and be happy if you get the close price. You can read our recommendations and tips that will definitely help you when <strong><a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/buy-motorbike-in-vietnam">buying a motorbike in Vietnam</a></strong>.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You can definitely profit by selling your bike if you have at least a week in the ending destination. That way, you have all the time to check different potential buyers and also, it gives you a negotiation power since you’re not in a rush. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When your flight is leaving in a few hours, the last thing you’ll think about is to earn like $50 on selling your bike!</span>
<h2><b>#29- Take Coffee and Food Breaks&nbsp;</b></h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4781" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.refreshment-on-the-road.jpg" alt="Don't forget to take refreshments on the road" width="4160" height="2340">

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Driving a long distance on the bikes that are not designed for it will be very exhausting and painful, especially for your back and ass. If you’re on a taller side, you’ll definitely have a problem adjusting your body to the motorbike since the bikes are produced for the local population that is in general shorter than westerners. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">After a long driving, you will feel an urge to stop and refresh yourself. Also, don’t forget about your old motorbike to always make stops so the engine can rest a bit. Many locals recommend us to stop every 100 km to give ourselves and our motorbikes a rest. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s incredible that no matter where you are you will always stumble upon coffee shops or restaurants on the road. Our favorite refreshment drink was a cold <a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/vietnamese-drip-coffee-guide"><strong>Vietnamese drip coffee</strong></a> or Nuoc Mia (sugarcane juice)! It’s filled with natural sugar, it’s cold and it makes the job to hydrate you and make you ready for the road ahead.</span>

Did you know Vietnam is the country with such a diverse, fresh and delicious street food? Don't forget to taste one of delicious <a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/vietnamese-street-food"><strong>street food delicacies</strong> </a>while traveling around Vietnam.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t try to rush that extra kilometer when you feel tired! Just stop for a while, take your time, enjoy the local cuisine, give your motorbike a rest and continue when you feel it.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The roads are a dangerous place to wander around when you’re tired, so don’t risk!</span>
<h2><b>#30- Be Extra Cautious While Crossing the Road&nbsp;</b></h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4766" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.careful-intersections.jpg" alt="Always check intersections even if it's green light" width="4160" height="2340">

<span style="font-weight: 400;">No matter if you’re one crossing the road or you notice people crossing the road, be extra cautious! People crossing the road usually have a rough time since no one seems to care about them. It’s very dangerous for both parties - drivers and walkers.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In small towns and rural areas it’s not a huge deal, but try to cross the road in big cities and you will get what we’re talking about. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In traffic, it’s vital that you can read the situation, or be very accurate in that since you’ll know how to react without causing trouble for anyone, including you. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Whenever you see someone crossing the road, always slow down! Check the mirrors since some people won’t notice that someone tries to cross the road and that’s a widespread accident cause. </span>
<h2><b>#32- Traffic in Saigon and Hanoi is Tough! Be Ready!</b></h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4783" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.traffic-in-saigon.jpg" alt="traffic in Saigon can be pretty tough" width="4160" height="2340">

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s interesting how local people who’re living in the city don’t usually travel around the country by the motorbike. After talking with many locals, the usual answer is <em>'It’s too dangerous to drive around the country.'</em>.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We would say that the most dangerous parts to drive around Vietnam are cities like Hanoi and Saigon. These two cities combined have more than 20 million residents and only God knows how many motorbikes in the traffic. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Traffic jams are a usual part of life in the cities and when you add the lack of respecting the rules, you make a very dangerous environment for anyone involved in traffic. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s very tough to drive in these two cities, so if you don’t have any prior driving experience, be sure to take time to get used to your motorbike before hitting the road. Traffic is scary and so many things happen at once, so there are too many things to focus and you don’t want to put so much effort in figuring out how your motorbike works when you’re in the middle of the chaos. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Another piece of advice is to avoid rush hours that usually happen around 7 am, 11 am and 5 pm!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s good to check the weather forecast so you can mentally prepare yourself for an upcoming day, but don’t put all of your bucks into the reliability of the forecast.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We were always making sure that we have the idea of the weather we can expect on the road, but all the time, there were some terrible misses in predictions.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The weather in Vietnam is very unpredictable, especially once you hit the famous Highlands near the Laos and Cambodian border. In one moment you will experience a clear sky with a fantastic view in front and around you, while after the next hill there is a small storm waiting for you.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You never know what to expect, so always make sure to have a raincoat and rain cover for your luggage ready.</span>
<h2><b>#34- Lock Your Bike or Park It On the Secured Spot!</b></h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4778" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.park-your-bike-secure.jpg" alt="Park your bike on a secure place" width="4160" height="2340">

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Bike robberies aren’t very common around the country, but still, there is a possibility that your bike won’t be at the place you parked it the last night. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The scary situation happened to Antonio on our first night of the trip in Hanoi. We went to an expat pub and we parked our bikes in front of the pub. After a while, Antonio went outside to check his bike and he couldn’t find it. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Imagine the scene 'Dude where’s my bike!'</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">He was searching his bike for a while and finally found it thrown in the middle of the small alley. It happens when you park in front of someone’s doors, so always be aware where you park your bike. </span>
<blockquote>
<h3><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">We advise you to invest in a durable U-lock and always park in a secured parking place. It costs like 5,000 - 10,000 VND for a whole day and you can really relax without worrying about your bike.</span></em></h3>
</blockquote>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Many hotels/hostels/guesthouses have the parking lots for motorbikes, so while you’re staying in, you can really enjoy the experience. Just be sure to check if your accommodation has the secured parking on site. If they don’t have one, then they will probably just park the bike inside the lobby during the night.</span>
<h2><b>#35- Have a Rain Cover For Your Luggage</b></h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4780" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.rain-cover-for-luggage.jpg" alt="Rain cover for your luggage is very important" width="4160" height="2340">

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The rain cover for your luggage is the must!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It doesn’t need to be an original backpack poncho or cover, but make sure that you always have a waterproof cover when traveling on a motorbike since the weather is very unpredictable. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We bought a few trash bags and always covered our luggage with these before every trip, even if it was sunny since once it starts to pour, it takes a bit to cover the luggage and hit the road again. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Always have all the things that you might require for the trip in your daypack since you don’t want to reach your luggage and uncover the rain cover searching for something you need! </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a pain in the ass and it’s never enough emphasizing this! </span>
<h2><b>#36- Get a High-Quality Full-Face Helmet</b></h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4772" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.invest-in-full-face-helmet.jpg" alt="Invest in the best full-face helmet you can find on the market" width="4160" height="2340">

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Having a good helmet while driving a motorbike is a common-sense, but you will see many people driving with the baseball-hat type of helmets. These helmets can’t protect you from anything, but it serves the purpose of avoiding the problems with police when driving around.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The protection and quality standard in Vietnam is different than around the world, so we advise you to buy a helmet and bring it from your home country. You won’t have any problems or extra costs while doing that. Lovel brought his helmet from Croatia just in case to be extra safe. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When buying a motorbike, the sellers will usually provide you with their helmets that are very unsafe and can’t protect you much, so always invest in a full-face helmet once in Vietnam.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Antonio bought a full-face helmet from Royal company for 500,000 VND and the quality isn’t the best, but for Vietnamese standard, it is a helmet that can protect you from serious injuries.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t be cheap and invest in a good helmet. You don’t want that few dollar helmet is protecting your head. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It doesn’t sound safe or smart at all! </span>
<h2><b>#37- Take Enough Time to Buy/Sell a Motorbike</b></h2>
<p id="MMlTpgH"><img class="wp-image-4795 size-full aligncenter" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.img_5cfdf416a4651.jpg" alt="Selling your bike in Saigon is a good move" width="1152" height="809"></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Buying and selling a bike is a whole process that requires proper planning and organization. The market of the motorbikes in Vietnam is enormous, so getting the best deal can be tricky. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When buying a bike, we advise you to take a day or two to explore the market and check out a few bikes. Don’t buy the first bike and just take your time when buying! </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The same goes for selling. If you want to get the asked price for your bike, then prepare to put some effort into selling. We did a whole marketing campaign for selling our bikes a week prior we reached Saigon. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Always start with planning and organizing before as you don’t want to be stuck in the country with the bikes and flight in a few hours. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s an excellent recipe for underselling your bike! </span>
<h2><b>#38- Be Comfortable While Driving&nbsp;</b></h2>
<p id="IUiAJSt"><img class="alignnone wp-image-4796 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.img_5cfdf474ea78f.jpg" alt="beautiful nature around Vietnam" width="1145" height="839"></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Never start to drive long distance until you’re not feeling completely comfortable in the chaotic traffic. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, David never drove anything else than a bicycle in his life, so we had a tough time when starting our trip in Hanoi. Traffic there is very chaotic, so we were a bit skeptical about how it will all go with David and his motorbike.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We decided that the best would be that he goes for a scooter since it’s straightforward to drive it without thinking about changing the gears. His only concern was being present and aware of things that going on around him. He did a few test drives around calmer parts of the city and once he got a grasp for the motorbike, we just started to drive around the city.</span>

Don't forget to read our detailed guide that will make your <a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/motorbike-trip-in-vietnam"><strong>motorbike trip in Vietnam</strong></a> much better and comfortable.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">At first, you will feel very uncomfortable dealing with traffic and rules, since no one seems to respect the rules, but after a day or two, you will start to feel more comfortable. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Just drive slow and follow the flow and you’ll be fine. And yeah, don’t become too comfortable as the accidents usually happen when you start thinking you’re a master in traffic. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Ask Antonio what happens when you become too comfortable and start to drive recklessly around the Vietnamese traffic! </span>
<h2><b>#39- Never Enough Bungees for Your Luggage</b></h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4775" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.never-enough-straps7.jpg" alt="Get at least four bungee straps" width="4160" height="2340">

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Always be sure that you have at least two more bungees than you need!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The last thing you want to experience is losing your valuables somewhere on the road. It’s hard to notice your luggage falling from the bike since you have to focus on many things while driving and also the sound of your motorbike and traffic don’t go into your advantage. </span>
<blockquote>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>You can buy bungees everywhere, but we were mainly buying in the local markets. The price for one bungee is around 10,000 VND so that it won’t break your bank, but it will make one worry go away!</em> </span></h3>
</blockquote>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Our tip is to tie a backpack strap to your pants while driving so in case of backpack going loose, you’ll feel it on your pants. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, we had an experience of breaking the bungees many times. When it breaks you can always tie it together and reuse. But anyway, get few just in case. </span>
<h2><b>#40- Get Lost Sometimes!</b></h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4770" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.get-lost.jpg" alt="Get lost and you'll stumble upon some great scenes" width="4608" height="3456">

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t blindly stick to the planned itinerary or the route. Wander around and take that unknown way or small alley that definitely doesn’t seem to bring you to the destination. You never know what beauty you are about to encounter!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We were always doing that, so we stumbled upon too many outstanding places during our travels around Vietnam. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s tough to get lost since Google Maps is always helpful, but also, if you don’t have an internet connection don’t forget to install (and download maps) <strong><a href="https://maps.me/">Maps.me</a></strong> which is a great map application that works offline too. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Go off-the-beaten-path since it will provide you with the views and experiences that will stay with you forever! For instance, we decided to skip all boat tours in Ha Long Bay and decided to <a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/halong-bay-vietnam"><strong>climb Bai Tho mountain</strong></a>! It was such a good decision.&nbsp;</span>
<h2><b>#41- Have an Idea on Gas Level or You’re Going to Push the Bike Around</b></h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4769" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.fuel-levels.jpg" alt="Always be on top your fuel levels" width="4160" height="2340">

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Regular backpacker’s motorbikes aren’t in the best condition, so it’s scarce that you’ll stumble upon a bike with a working speedometer and all indicators on the driver’s board. The gas indicator is probably one of the most important things you can have on your bike. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Luckily for us, we had two bikes with working gas indicators which makes our trip much more pleasant since after a while we knew how many kilometers we can drive with the full gas tank. The problem was Antonio and his old Sufat Win which didn’t have any indicator and it was a bit hard to predict how much fuel is remaining in a tank. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Always be aware of the level of the fuel in your gas tank. If you don’t have a working gas indicator and you’re not sure about the levels of the gas and the consumption of your motorbike, be sure to have one water bottle filled with the gas on you.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Another good advice would be to always fill your gas tank to the top before starting a long journey as it will save a lot of time if you run out of the gas in the middle of nowhere. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking for an unforgettable adventure? Just hit up Antonio as he became a professional bike pusher in all kinds of terrains around the country!</span>
<h2><b>#42- Always Check Your Kickstand Before You Start Driving!</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes, when you just start driving a motorbike, you may forget about the kickstand. It's very dangerous to drive with kickstand pulled down, especially in the curves during the higher speed. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Usually, that results in the accident, so don’t forget to take a second to check if you pulled the kickstand up!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, it’s a hilarious fact, but the police can actually stop you if they see you driving with a pulled kickstand and write you a fine. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Vietnamese people always scream or point at your kickstand if they notice you driving like that! Such a friendly bunch of people!</span>
<h2><b>#43- Make Stretching a Habit!</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Driving a long distance is a very exhausting activity, especially on the motorbike that isn’t designed for that purpose. If you buy a regular backpacker’s motorbike like Honda Wave or Win, you can expect a very uncomfortable bike, especially if you’re a taller person. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">After a few hard days sitting on the bike, you will definitely feel that your body is crushed, so it’s very smart to do daily stretches combined with massage here and there. We took about 5 - 10 minutes per day to stretch and it helped a lot. Also, physical activities like hiking, running and swimming help a lot!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The foam roller is fantastic equipment to always have in your bag, especially if you don’t want to spend money or time on massage that may not be that beneficial. </span>
<h2><b>#44- Be One With the Flow of Traffic</b></h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqIHDLPVS3w" width="764" height="430" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you land in Vietnam and see the traffic, there is a huge possibility you’ll be shocked.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We were very shocked at our first sights of traffic and we couldn’t believe we’re going to travel around the whole country on motorbikes. It seemed so dangerous and impossible at that time.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are so many things going on at the same time and when you add that traffic rules are almost non-existent, you simply don’t get any idea how is it possible to drive a motorbike in Vietnam safely. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It very bizarre to see traffic going on around the huge crossroad. It looks like everyone starts driving at the same time and somehow everyone avoids each other without any accidents. To an observer, it may seem very impressive and impossible, but once you start driving, you will realize there are patterns and specific flow in traffic. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">People can read situations and adjust to it very good which makes it much easier once you get used to it. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The best advice we can give you here is to follow the flow. Don’t drive faster than anyone else, don’t do things no one else is doing and you’ll figure things out. </span>
<h2><b>#45- Drive Relaxed - This Isn't a Road Rage Country!</b></h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9vBFO_2ZeQ" width="764" height="430" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This one applies basically everywhere in the world - never drive tired or stressed! For some countries, it goes a long way, especially when we’re talking about Vietnamese traffic. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Honking culture is entirely different than in the western world and it’s usually not a sign of aggression but rather politeness. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t drive recklessly and always respect other people and their safety!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When someone pulls out something stupid or dangerous in traffic, don’t stress yourself over it since you’ll encounter many illogical and dangerous things people are doing in the traffic. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Just kindly remind yourself you’re in Vietnam and it’s time to adjust to Vietnamese traffic. </span>
<h2><b>#46- Remember to Double Check Both Sides at Intersections!</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Be extra careful when crossing intersections, especially in the cities. Even if there is a traffic light, always drive slow and check both sides!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The habit of people is to start driving when the red light is still on (a few seconds before green light), which makes it extremely dangerous for the ongoing traffic on the other side of intersection which still has a green light on. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Always slow down on the intersection and check both sides twice before crossing. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We saw quite a few accidents that looked very nasty on the intersections because people didn’t slow down or other people started to drive before their green light. </span>
<h2><b>#47- Choose Your Bike Type Wisely Depending on Your Skill Level&nbsp;</b></h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4782" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.semi-automatic-bike.jpg" alt="Semi automatic bike" width="4608" height="3456">

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When buying a bike for your epic motorbike trip around Vietnam, always have in mind your motorbike skills and prior experience. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">With a regular motorbike license, it’s illegal to drive any bike that is bigger than 175 cc. Even if you want to get a big bike, it’s tough to find a bike and it will be even harder to sell it on a limited time, so we advise you to skip it and go with a regular backpackers’ bike. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The most common bikes are automatic, semi-automatic and manuals that range from 110 to 125 cc. Choose your bike according to your skill levels and experience.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, if you plan to drive two people and the luggage on the bike, it’s advisable to go for 125 - 150 cc since you’ll need more power to pass all the obstacles waiting for you on the road! </span>
<h2><b>#48- Don't Drive Batshit Drunk or High!</b></h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4768" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.dont-drink-and-drive.jpg" alt="Drink when you know you're not going to drive" width="4160" height="2340">

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This one is so logical and it’s almost no point in mentioning it, but still, there are always people who’re driving after a rough drinking night, including us sometimes. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Driving under the influence not only puts you in danger but also all the people in the traffic around you. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The <a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/public-transportation-in-vietnam"><strong>transportation options in Vietnam</strong></a> are vast, so whenever you plan to have a great night with a few drinks, always call a Grab or take public transport. It’s cheaper and safer than sitting on a motorbike and risking the life of you and others. </span>
<h2><b>#49- Respect Locals - You're the Guest After All!</b></h2>
<p id="ObDDiId"><img class="alignnone wp-image-4797 size-full" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.img_5cfdf4a7d5f62.jpg" alt="Locals enjoying their food and drinks" width="1167" height="865"></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t be a disrespectful foreigner who thinks of himself as the owner of the country just because of the money. We saw many people like these, just throwing money at people, not respecting their customs, traditions or culture. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It looks very impolite and it gives a bad reputation to all foreign travelers. Please learn about the culture and be respectful to people. Vietnamese people are thrilled, friendly and hospitable people willing to help at any time. Don’t make these nice people change their minds over time. Antonio had a chance to <a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/tet-holiday-vietnam"><strong>celebrate Tet holiday with a local family</strong></a>!</span>
<h2><b>#50- Don't Contribute to Environment Pollution and Be Conscious About It!</b></h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETCkhz9jFYw" width="764" height="430" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Pollution levels are high and awareness levels are extremely low. People mainly lack the proper education when it comes to environmental preservation, so don’t be shocked to see pollution all around you. It became part of Vietnamese culture. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We were very shocked when we traveled around the countryside through small fishermen villages where people mainly live from fresh seafood. The beaches and the surrounding area serves as a place to throw the trash for the local population. When you think about it, these people are basically shooting themselves in the foot by doing that since they are decreasing the quality and number of the fish which means less money for them. Who knows and who can predict what’s waiting for the future generations without the proper education. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Please don’t leave traces behind you when traveling around Vietnam and you never know, maybe you’ll inspire some locals by your example. Don’t order takeaways or if you order, make sure that you bring your own reusable cup or container for the food. Buy a reusable water bottle, refuse a plastic straw in your drink and also, put your things to a reusable bag instead of using plastic bags.</span>

		<Content><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Traveling is an ultimate eye-opening experience. It's a great tool for people who want to grow through experiencing new cultures, meeting new people, and starting to appreciate the fortunate in their lives. For us, travelers, it’s always attractive, but at the same time challenging, to move to a completely new environment to learn about the world and ourselves. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A traveling lifestyle has many benefits, but also comes with a great number of daily challenges. Depending on the place you’re coming from, Vietnam can be very tough for first-timers in a sense of culture shocks. If you’ve never been to SEA before and Vietnam is your first country in that region, then you will definitely experience cultural shocks. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t be scared as it’s a normal thing! Just open your mind, be ready to learn and you will <strong>fall in love with Vietnamese culture and people</strong>. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve been traveling and living in many regions (provinces) in Vietnam and we faced many challenges when it comes to cultural differences. In this article, we’d like to put all the culture shocks we experienced and kind of prepare you, so you know what to expect!</span>

<em><strong>Always expect the unexpected in Vietnam! That’s one of the things we can promise you!</strong></em>

<em><strong>Note:&nbsp;</strong>We are constantly going to update this article as we're sure that there are many other culture shocks we haven't experienced yet! If you have anything to add, don't hesitate to share it with us!</em>

<em><strong>Note 2:&nbsp;</strong>This post is around 9,000 words which means you probably need about 40 minutes to read it and think about things you're going to experience in Vietnam!</em>

<strong><em>So make yourself a coffee, find a comfortable place and let's dip in culture shocks in Vietnam you're going to experience!</em></strong>

<h2><b>#1 Motorbikes On Each Step</b></h2>
<div class="image_description"><img class="size-full wp-image-1417" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.1.jpg" alt="Motorbikes in Vietnam are everywhere" width="4608" height="3456"> <em>There are around 45 million registered motorbikes on the population of around 95 million. Bikes are everywhere!</em></div>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Vietnam is the country with around <strong><a href="https://e.vnexpress.net/news/business/vietnam-remains-kingdom-of-motorbikes-as-sales-rev-up-in-2016-3527969.html">45 million registered motorbikes</a></strong> on roughly 90 million residents. There are also many bikes that are not registered around the countryside, so only God knows how many bikes are in the traffic on a daily basis!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The first thing you will probably notice is the chaotic traffic coming at you from all angles and sides. It’s literally chaos since <strong>everyone is using honks and it looks like no one respects any traffic rules. </strong></span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When we first arrived in Hanoi, we were blown away by the traffic mainly because our trip was about traveling around Vietnam on the motorbike! Literally, there are thousands of motorbikes on every step and it seemed our trip won’t work since we weren’t expecting anything close to that.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We must say that no matter how bad it looks like at first, driving in the traffic is manageable since it seems like everyone has the <strong>sense of other people in the traffic</strong>. </span>
<blockquote>
<h3><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everything, traffic related, goes with the flow!</span></em></h3>
</blockquote>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The biggest challenge is to get used to the traffic and get the confidence to go with the flow. Once you get confident driving around the cities, then you will realize why and how the chaotic traffic works in Vietnam. </span>
<h2><b>#2 Street Vendors and Shops Are Part of the Culture</b></h2>
<div class="image_description"><img class="size-full wp-image-1418" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.2.jpg" alt="" width="4608" height="3456"> <em>Street vendors and shops are a deep part of Vietnamese culture.</em></div>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Basically, every household has their own shop where they sell goods or services. Everyone is doing the same, but small details differ from shop to shop. From the first look, it seems that Vietnamese people are born entrepreneurs, but in the reality, some of the people really struggle to feed and support their families, so having a street shop can supplement the money for the family. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">These days, that's the main thing that shows you the authenticity of Vietnamese culture. The food is usually the best there as everything is fresh and prepared in front of you. The only concern we had was the cleanness of the food.</span>
<blockquote>
<h3><em>Food is so diverse, so delicious, so fresh and so cheap on the street!</em></h3>
</blockquote>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">We were eating for a few months only on the street and didn’t experience any problems with the food poisoning. Probably very lucky guys! </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, street food is <strong>quite cheap compared to food in the restaurants</strong>&nbsp;and there is even a space for bargaining. </span>

<em><span style="font-weight: 400;">What’s the better way to learn and immerse in Vietnamese culture than walking around street shops and experiencing new things?</span></em>
<h2><b>#3 Inequality of Women in Countryside</b></h2>
<div class="image_description"><img class="size-full wp-image-1419" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.3.jpg" alt="A hardworking woman in traffic" width="4608" height="3456"> <em>Women still experience a huge inequality in Vietnam, but by statistics, the situation is getting better.</em></div>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s generally noticeable everywhere in the country, but in the countryside, you can see the <strong><a href="https://vietnamnews.vn/opinion/405824/gender-inequality-slows-vn-economy.html#0tXhlVFHjS4fFc3e.97">inequality and the way people treat women</a></strong> instantly. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We must say it shocked us so much when we saw how much problems women have with finding a proper job without getting a lot of stigma from the villagers. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We saw few cases where men <strong>publically physically assault women</strong> in front of many other people, but no one seemed to care. Also, you won’t see many women smoking publicly or at home since that’s a huge stigma around and cigarettes are only reserved for men.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The really shocking thing was that woman can be seen <strong>working the hardest jobs on the heat</strong>. Men usually work with them, but only as supervisors, so it’s not a strange thing to see a few women building a house together while men drink and smoke in the shade.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Being a woman in Vietnam is hard since there is much pressure from society on the <em>‘good’</em> values every woman should possess. The main role of women is usually perceived as a household wife taking care of the family while the man is a person who’s bringing the money to the table.</span>
<h2><b>#4 Huge Gap Between Rich and Poor</b></h2>
<div class="image_description"><img class="size-full wp-image-1420" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.4.jpg" alt="Happy kids from countryside" width="4608" height="3456"> <em>There are many poor communities around the country, especially in Highlands. The biggest mindfuck is to see these people smiling and being so happy. It makes you think about consumerism and materialism!</em></div>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">A <strong><a href="https://vietnamnews.vn/society/349627/inequality-on-the-rise-in-viet-nam.html#2vSuWIMVMR0BY87Y.97">gap between rich and poor</a></strong> is still very noticeable in Vietnam, especially in the countryside. In the cities, you can still see it, but we’d say it’s not that noticeable like in the countryside. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The good thing is that almost every person has their own way of transportation, so logistic cost is at its minimum. Motorbikes are cheap and there are parts on each step, so maintaining the bike in Vietnam is the least of problems. Rich people usually drive cars that are much more expensive in Vietnam since they put a <strong>crazy huge import tax on cars</strong> to promote the local car businesses.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Normal people still struggle to get few million dongs per month to support their family, while other people, mainly people in the government or businesses, are getting hundreds of millions per month as corruption makes it easier for selected people.</span>
<blockquote>
<h3><em>The gap between rich and poor is wider than ever in Vietnam.</em></h3>
</blockquote>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In one street, you will see modern houses and it won’t look like Vietnam at all, but on another street, you will see the struggle of the average family; people are living in self-made houses with tiny and not durable roofs that have many holes. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Like in many developing countries, rich are getting richer and poor are getting poorer. </span>
<h2><b>#5 Language Barrier is Real!</b></h2>
<div class="image_description"><img class="size-full wp-image-1421" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.5.jpg" alt="Language in Vietnam" width="4608" height="3456"> <em>Even in big cities, you will experience a huge language barrier. Always have Google Translate and patience prepared!</em></div>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Vietnam is still in a developing phase, but the rate of development is so rapid that even locals <strong>can’t recognize their hometowns when compared ten years ago</strong>. Big cities are welcoming tourists a</span>nd majority of Vietnamese coast and economy, in general, is relying on tourism. The infrastructure is modern in some places, but again, the language barrier is real.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the cities, sometimes you will have the <strong>struggle to find an English speaking person</strong> who can clearly communicate the needs with you. You should look at a very specific community to be able to find English speaking people.</span>
<blockquote>
<h3><em>Even English teachers have struggle communicating in English since they mainly focus on writing, reading and listening skills in formal education.</em></h3>
</blockquote>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to the countryside, the situation is very crazy as literally, no one can’t speak more than plain basics. We were shocked when we realized that <strong>even English teachers have a struggle while communicating in English</strong>. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Before coming, we really advise you to learn basic Vietnamese phrases as it will help you a lot and people will have more respect for you. Also, if for any reason you don’t learn the phrases, a good ol’ Google Translate will be a handy application when dealing with locals. </span>
<h2><b>#6 Family First</b></h2>
<div class="image_description"><img class="size-full wp-image-1422" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.6.jpg" alt="Family dinner" width="4160" height="2340"> <em>It's amazing how much value Vietnamese people put to the family. It's simply an amazing </em>feeling<em> of being together with a Vietnamese family.</em></div>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a very heartwarming thing to see how much respect and love Vietnamese people give to their family. The family here is everything. Everything!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s funny how they usually build their houses in height since <strong>every floor is designed for one part of the family</strong>. The sons usually invite their parents to their houses when they get the jobs so their family doesn’t need to worry about finances or anything since the sons will take care.</span>

<strong>Did you know:&nbsp;<a href="https://saigoneer.com/vietnam-news/2592-study-divorce-is-up-significantly-in-vietnam">Divorce rate in Vietnam skyrockets!</a></strong>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">People are getting married very young. The rate in the cities is becoming better by western averages, but in the countryside, it’s not a strange thing to see <strong>18 year old kids married with a kid or two</strong>. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Vietnamese people also pay much respect for people who passed away, so they hold the anniversaries of death. During that time, they give offerings in form of food or money to their loved ones, spend time with a close family while enjoying the food and alcoholic drinks.</span>
<h2><b>#7 Delicious Fresh Food and Much Alcohol</b></h2>
<div class="image_description"><img class="size-full wp-image-1423" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.7.jpg" alt="Food in north" width="4160" height="3120"> <em>Food in Vietnam is so diverse, delicious and fresh! It also goes very well with alcoholic drinks like beer or iconic rice wine.</em></div>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Vietnam is widely known by its <strong>healthy and diverse cuisine</strong> that will satisfy all your needs! It’s so amazing how the food they make is so fresh and the combination of ingredients simply makes every dish out of this world. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Probably the first Vietnamese food we tried was a simple Pho in the street shop in Hanoi. It was totally mind-blowing how the tastes and combination of ingredients make the simple soup so complex! </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The country literally has hundreds of different food to choose, so even the pickiest people when it comes to food will fill their bellies. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Food is extremely cheap if you eat on the street. The best advice we can give to you is to always look for the places <strong>filled with local people as it means the food is cheap and very</strong> <strong>delicious.</strong> You simply can’t miss these places!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, if you’re coming from the western countries, then you probably know eating outside can be very expensive and if you’re on the budget then you probably need to cook your own food. Guess what? Not in Vietnam!</span>

<strong>Fun Fact:</strong>&nbsp;We spent roughly <strong><a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/vietnam-on-a-budget">$5 per day on a food</a></strong> during our motorbike trip from Hanoi to Saigon.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The food options are endless and the prices are even cheaper than the prices of all ingredients for cooking at your home! Street food is really the way to go to Vietnam! </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to eating, it’s hard to see any table without countless beers around! People simply know how to combine their food with alcohol to make the experience to a whole another level. </span>
<h2><b>#8 Cigarettes are Dirty Cheap</b></h2>
<div class="image_description"><img class="size-full wp-image-1443" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.IMG_20180521_212259.jpg" alt="Cigarettes are cheap" width="4160" height="3120"> <em>Many people smoke in Vietnam. Antonio started to smoke since cigarettes cost pennies here. Be careful!</em></div>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, the pack of popular Thang Long costs only 10k VND. Marlboro packs cost about 25 - 30k VND.</span>

<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">You get the idea!</span></i>
<blockquote>
<h3><em>In western countries, you stop to smoke, but in Vietnam, you start!</em></h3>
</blockquote>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s very evident that Vietnam has a huge problem with smoking since everyone smokes! We’re not only talking about the health problems, but also about the environment and trace we’re leaving by smoking. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Almost every beach is filled with <strong><a href="https://www.csmonitor.com/Environment/2009/1118/earth-talk-little-cigarette-butts-make-big-litter-impact">cigarette butts which takes a lot of time to decompose</a></strong>, especially in the country whose people are not so much aware of environmental problems and don’t have a proper recycling program. </span>
<h2><b>#9 Tracking Time by Different Calendar</b></h2>
<div class="image_description"><img class="size-full wp-image-1460" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.tet_-1.jpg" alt="Tet holiday" width="1280" height="847"> <em>Vietnamese people are tracking time by the lunar calendar. Their biggest holiday is called Tet and it falls in February.</em></div>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In western cultures, people track time by following the solar calendar, but in Vietnam, people mainly use a <strong>lunar calendar</strong>. As Vietnam became opened to the tourism industry and international businesses, more people started to use the solar calendar as the main thing to track the time when it comes to business. However, in the family and personal lives, Vietnamese people still count time by the lunar calendar. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Their biggest holiday, <strong>Tet holiday or New Year</strong> is celebrated in early February, but they also celebrate a normal New Year following a solar calendar. Don't forget to read the article that follows the <a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/tet-holiday-vietnam"><strong>celebration of the Tet holiday</strong></a> through Antonio's perspective.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, twice per every month, people are burning incense, money and offering food to their beloved ones who passed away during the full moon. During that time, people don’t eat meat and follow the vegetarian diet. </span>
<h2><b>#10 Siesta Time</b></h2>
<div class="image_description"><img class="size-full wp-image-1424" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.10.jpg" alt="Woman sleeping on the motorbike" width="4608" height="3456"> <em>After</em> <em>lunch, people will relax which means you will stumble upon people sleeping on the street in hammocks, on motorbikes, etc.</em></div>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Probably not the right name in Vietnam, but you get what we mean by Siesta time. Vietnamese people get their Siesta time for real so you can see them <strong>doing nothing and chilling every day a few hours</strong> after they are done with lunch.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Some people enjoy their tea or coffee with friends or family, some people are taking naps in street hammocks while some people are reading books or doing things they don’t usually have time to do during the day.</span>
<blockquote>
<h3><em>Avoid local shops from 11 am - 2 pm as there is a huge possibility people are taking Siesta time and won't accept customers.</em></h3>
</blockquote>
<em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Want to buy something, eat or take a haircut? </span></em>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Forget about it since many people will say you to come later as they don’t want to have any interruptions in their Siesta time.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">To avoid this, simply take Siesta or <strong>avoid local shops from 11 am - 2 pm!</strong></span>
<h2><b>#11 Tea Goes Well With Tobacco</b></h2>
<div class="image_description"><img class="size-full wp-image-1425" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.11.jpg" alt="Their iconic bong" width="4160" height="3120"> <em>Food and tea are always going very well with a bamboo bong. Vietnamese people smoke tobacco from these pipes! Don't be too cocky or hard on these, since it will make you unconscious!</em></div>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve never experienced or saw such a huge part of the population drinking tea and smoking tobacco from bamboo bongs called <em>Thuốc láo</em>. It’s a crazy combination that actually goes pretty well together! Be careful while doing it since tobacco is very strong and when you take a hit from the bong it will give you lightheaded feeling. Water bong and strong tobacco is our <a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/souvenirs-from-vietnam"><strong>favorite souvenir from Vietnam</strong></a> that's extremely portable. Antonio got a cinnamon pipe from his host in Nghe An.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You can find tea in every street shop or local restaurant. Just look for a big bucket and you will usually find a few glasses that everyone uses. </span>

<em><strong>These glasses are for sharing the tea!</strong></em>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone can drink as much tea as possible, free of any cost. It goes really well after the hearty and fresh meal. </span>
<h2><b>#12 School Uniforms Are Still a Thing</b></h2>
<div class="image_description"><img class="size-full wp-image-1445" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.DSC07027.jpg" alt="School uniforms" width="3344" height="2224"> <em>Formal and sometimes, a bit more informal uniforms in schools are seen every day.</em></div>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">From early ages all the way to the end of high school, students are required to wear their <strong><a href="https://www.k12academics.com/School%20Uniforms/school-uniforms-vietnam">traditional school uniforms</a></strong>. That is a perfect example of how formal their schooling system is. To go even further, the girls are required to wear Áo dài which is a traditional dress in Vietnam, but also teachers are required to wear it. Every student has their name on the uniform too. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The regulations differ from school to school, but usually, students need to wear uniforms <strong>at least 2 times per week</strong> with a specific dress codes on certain days. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There were many complaints about the uniforms since people think it’s out of fashion and very uncomfortable. </span>
<h2><b>#13 Buses and Trucks are Playing Fast &amp; Furious on the Road</b></h2>
<div class="image_description"><img class="size-full wp-image-1452" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.IMG_0809.jpg" alt="A regular day in traffic " width="4608" height="3456"> <em>Be extremely aware of trucks and buses in traffic!</em></div>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re coming from western countries then you know public transport isn’t that fast and sometimes not on timing at all (especially in Croatia). In Vietnam, not only the public transport will cost you pennies, but also, the time you spend in transit will be much lower than the time you will spend driving your own motorbike. </span>

<em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Curious about the reason?</span></em>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, bus and truck drivers are the fastest on the road. Sometimes, it seems they don’t care about other people in the traffic. They are very <strong>aggressive on using their honks and producing all different rhythms</strong> while overtaking everything that’s moving in front of them. </span>
<blockquote>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>These drivers are getting paid bonuses when they reach a destination on time, so that’s one of the reasons they are always racing.</em> </span></h3>
</blockquote>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s very dangerous when you’re driving a motorbike and the buses or trucks are also in the traffic. Always be sure to take a <strong>close attention to your mirrors</strong> and what’s going on behind you! The last thing you want is a huge bus honking a few meters back from you in the full speed. </span>
<h2><b>#14 Lack of Toilet Paper</b></h2>
<div class="image_description"><img class="size-full wp-image-1455" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.toilet.jpg" alt="Toilet paper" width="1280" height="960"> <em>Lack of toilet paper is very evident in Vietnam so you'll need to get used to the bum gun.</em></div>
<em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah, that’s true! Not many places use toilet paper, so it’s time for you to get used to the bum gun or toilet sprayer!</span></em>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Many buildings are built long ago so the pipes are very old and toilet paper causes a blockage in the pipes. In many places, you will see the signs of people asking to <strong>throw a toilet paper in the bin instead of the toilet.</strong> </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a very strange experience to come to the toilet and not having a toilet paper, but the only option is a bum gun. It’s very weird at first, but after some practice, you realize it’s a better way without leaving so much trace. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>Be prepared to live without toilet paper!</em> </span>
<h2><b>#15 Dog Meat Trade</b></h2>
<div class="image_description"><img class="size-full wp-image-1426" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.15.jpg" alt="Vietnamese dog" width="4608" height="3456"> <em>Dog meat trade and consumption is still huge in Vietnam, especially in the northern regions.</em></div>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Vietnamese culture, as well as cuisine, has many influences from China. The dog meat is a popular delicacy in northern parts of the country. When you start moving south, you won’t stumble upon many dog meat restaurants or markets, but in the north is a different story. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Thai Binh, for instance, is the province near Hanoi and it’s a very popular place for dog and cat meat. People there consume a lot of dog meat and the majority of dog trade in Vietnam goes to that province.</span>

<strong>Did you know:&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://www.livekindly.co/hanoi-becomes-vietnams-first-city-ban-dog-meat-trade/">Hanoi became the first city in Vietnam to ban dog meat trade!</a>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s believed that dog meat makes people healthier and provides them with a strength through winters. Also, when people eat a dog meat, they feel a heat from the meat, so it’s not a strange thing the consumption almost triple during the winter months. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There is much controversy about dog meat trade, so more and more restaurants started to remove dog meat from their menus. Still, people in the countryside around north consume a lot as it’s a part of their tradition.</span>

<strong><em>What’s your thought on dog meat consumption? Please share your thoughts in the comment section.</em></strong>
<h2><b>#16 Countless Dialects</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Vietnam is a long country, geographically looking, that has 58 provinces. The very interesting fact comes when we’re talking about the Vietnamese language. The language is <strong>tonal with 6 different tones</strong> that completely change the meaning of the word if not used correctly. That’s the reason the Vietnamese language is a very hard one to master for foreigners.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Antonio was living in the countryside and the only way to communicate with people was to learn basic Vietnamese. He got along with locals in the north, but as soon as we hit the road, we realized that the <strong><a href="https://www.justlanded.com/english/Vietnam/Vietnam-Guide/Language/Language-and-dialects">language differs from place to place</a></strong>, from province to province. It’s crazy how Vietnamese can recognize where you’re coming from just by your dialect. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re planning to stay for longer in Vietnam, be prepare for a hustle when it comes to communicating on Vietnamese.</span>
<h2><b>#17 Food Flavors Depending on the Province</b></h2>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhMv_E9Sl_4

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This one you will experience on each kilometer while moving around Vietnam in any direction. For instance, we started our trip from Hanoi and the capital is famous for a delicious and fresh Pho (a noodle soup) and fried egg rice. Really, these dishes are amazing in Hanoi and it’s a great introduction to Vietnamese cuisine. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Once we started to move south, we didn’t experience many changes in the food until we reached Hue. There is a very hard task to find a good Pho, but Bun Bo Hue is on each step since it’s a traditional food from that region. It’s also a noodle soup, but with thicker and rounded noodles which differs from Pho in the north. </span>
<blockquote>
<h3><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Again, when you move further south you won’t only experience a difference in the food, but also the landscape and the food people are growing in the regions. </span></em></h3>
</blockquote>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, in the north paddy fields are everywhere, in Highlands, there are endless coffee fields while in the south you can experience many dragon fruit farms. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a really diverse country from all aspects and foodie lovers will definitely enjoy the experience!</span>
<h2><b>#18 Money Can Solve Every Problem</b></h2>
<div class="image_description"><img class=" wp-image-1444" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.48371686_219757998937192_8605722380678987776_n.jpg" alt="Vietnamese money" width="796" height="1062"> <em>Really, money can solve many problems in Vietnam!</em></div>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Money can probably solve any problem anywhere, but in Vietnam, it’s so common and widespread since the <strong><a href="https://www.transparency.org/country/VNM">corruption is at its high levels</a></strong>. The corruption can be seen from the lowest all the way to the highest levels in the government.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, the best example of how money is solving the problems in Vietnam is by dealing with Vietnamese police. Many foreigners drive illegally in Vietnam as the lack of documents is common in the country.</span>
<blockquote>
<h3><em>Almost every problem with the police can be solved with a few hundreds of Vietnamese dongs...</em></h3>
</blockquote>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Police sometimes target foreigners as there is a huge possibility the person will miss a document or because of the language barrier, the foreigner won’t mind giving away some money. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep in mind that 200k VND can solve almost any <strong><a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/vietnamese-police-guide">problem with the police</a>!</strong></span>
<h2><b>#19 No One Stops at Crossing - Be Aware If You're Walking!</b></h2>
<div class="image_description"><img class="size-full wp-image-1427" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.19.jpg" alt="Busy crossroad in Hue" width="4608" height="3456"> <em>When walking across the streets, be extremely cautious since no one will stop when you're crossing! You are the one who needs to avoid the traffic.</em></div>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This one almost gets us killed many times around the streets of Hanoi until we learned the lesson. Always be careful while crossing the street! </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><em><strong>Lesson learned:&nbsp;</strong>It’s not your home country where drivers get fined if they don’t stop to let a walker pass the road.</em> </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Vietnamese traffic is a jungle with wild beasts on each step. There are millions of motorbikes operating in the traffic each second and no one seems like paying attention to any traffic rules. </span>
<h2><b>#20 Pollution and Littering</b></h2>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETCkhz9jFYw

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Vietnam has a huge problem when it comes to pollution and littering that comes from the local population. It’s definitely not the worst place in SEA, but the<em><strong> trash floating around the ocean where the majority of the local community lives from seafood isn’t fun at all.</strong></em> </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The country is definitely lacking the education programs on the topic, as well as the recycling programs that will raise the awareness of people about the problem. There are many small projects where college students try to educate local communities about the problem and try to engage them to beach cleanups, but it’s still a small movement!</span>

<strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/cleanupvietnam/">Support and Join&nbsp;Clean Up Vietnam!</a></strong>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The littering is kinda deeply rooted in the culture since even the small kids don’t care about the trash. They just throw it anywhere and parents just find it alright. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s time to change it by educating people, especially a youth generation since the problem of pollution and plastics is huge on a global scale.</span>
<blockquote>
<h3><em>Who needs a banana or pineapple wrapped in a plastic bag? Or coffee with few straws?</em></h3>
</blockquote>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Just go to any store and ask for a takeaway and you will see how much plastics you get. Like 99% of that you don’t need, so it’s important that you’re also aware of the problem.</span>

<em><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s time to change a few habits in our daily lifestyle, don’t you think so?</span></em>
<h2><b>#21 Loud Speaking Country </b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s extremely weird and funny at the same time hearing Vietnamese people speaking in public. At first, it sounds like they are in the <em><strong>middle of the argument that is almost going to get physical</strong></em>, but no, that’s the way the people in Vietnam speak. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">People speak very loud and in many cases, it can be overwhelming to listen, even if you don’t understand a single thing.</span>
<blockquote>
<h3><em>When Vietnamese people speak in public, you may think they are about to get into a fist fight, but in the reality, that's just a way of communicating.</em></h3>
</blockquote>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The best thing is when they get a phone call in the middle of the crowded sleeper bus. They start to scream on the phone with a slight smile on their face. It’s amazing and annoying at the same time, so be prepared for that! </span>
<h2><b>#22 Loud Eaters Too</b></h2>
<div class="image_description"><img class="size-full wp-image-1446" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.IMG_20180801_174028.jpg" alt="Eating in the countryside" width="4160" height="2340"> <em>Vietnamese people eat very sound and loud.</em></div>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In western countries, people usually eat with a closed mouth; that’s the <strong><a href="http://livinglocal.triip.me/10-dos-and-donts-of-vietnamese-dining-etiquette/">eating etiquette</a></strong>. Again, in Vietnam, it’s not the case. People seem like they are proud to demonstrate their skills in loud eating while talking and collecting the pieces of food around. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For a Croatian person, it was a strange thing at the beginning, but after living in Vietnam for 9 months, I don’t even notice that people are eating really loud. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In western cultures, people have usually schooled table manners, but in Vietnam, only a few percentages of families are schooling their kids' table manners. Basically, loud eating means people enjoy the food they are eating.</span>
<h2><b>#23 Sense of Time</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Vietnamese sense of time is on total another level. If you ever had a friend who’s always late, don’t think you will be prepared for Vietnamese people.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes it’s funny, sometimes is totally annoying when you have a meeting with Vietnamese (casual meeting) and they <strong>usually come late or don’t come at all.</strong> </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We talked with many people around Vietnam about it and many people shared the same experience when it comes to drinking coffee and relaxing with Vietnamese people. When it comes to business and making money, Vietnamese people are always on time. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We had many experiences with Vietnamese local people and many times <strong>we need to say 20 minutes before we reached the place that we’re already there.</strong> Sometimes, they even come late! </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>You never know and it’s hard to be prepared for it!</em> Welcome to Vietnam! </span>
<h2><b>#24 If Something is Working Don’t Try to Make it Better</b></h2>
<div class="image_description"><img class="size-full wp-image-1451" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.Redmi-Note-4595.jpg" alt="Building the ships in the countryside" width="4160" height="2340"> <em>Some things are very ineffective in Vietnam, but they work. People seem not to care about it, so they just continue doing the things the way it's working. Why </em>to<em> improve something if it's already working?</em></div>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Through our experiences, Vietnamese people are very satisfied with the current situation of the things. Even if there is a huge possibility to improve they will just leave it as it is. It was very surprising for us since we were sharing many ideas with locals who were in different kind of businesses as there are so many gaps in Vietnam.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">People are very interested, but they usually won’t do anything or won’t show any initiative since the things already work for them just enough to feed their families.</span>
<blockquote>
<h3><em>It's working, so why to make it better?</em></h3>
</blockquote>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">We are mainly talking about the English centers and English speaking cafes as we have a lot of experience in helping and working with these. People are so interested and respectful when you give them the ideas, but you will have a hard time to put the idea to work in Vietnam.</span>

<strong>Want to know:&nbsp;<a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/starlight-english-center-vietnam">How teaching in the countryside looks like?</a></strong>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We still don’t know the reason why people are like that, but we believe it’s because of security. People usually take care of the big families and they were building their businesses or ways of living for a long time. So, they are not up for risking that all to make their life a few levels better. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Probably it hugely depends on your experiences and the current point in life, so you might not see this as a culture shock at all. </span>
<h2><b>#25 Rice Wine is Dirty Cheap</b></h2>
<div class="image_description"><img class="size-full wp-image-1428" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.25.jpg" alt="Rice wine with geckos inside" width="3120" height="4160"> <em>People are mixing their rice wine with many different animals including lizards, geckos, snakes, and who knows what else.</em></div>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Local people, especially older generations in the countryside are literally killing the rice wine. The consumption is so huge since almost every household in the countryside has their own piece of land with the rice field. Also, many people will proudly show you their ‘distillery’ where they produce their beloved drink.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The bottle of <strong>0.5l of homemade alcohol costs about 20k VND in the city</strong>, but we managed to find it even cheaper, but wouldn’t advise you to try it as the day after isn’t the most pleasurable. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s important to mention that it’s not the best quality alcohol and probably it will cause a stomach ache and crazy intense hungover. </span>

<em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anyway, once you’re in Vietnam, you should try it and experience it like a local! It’s a lot of fun!</span></em>
<h2><b>#26 Sleeping Buses </b></h2>
<div class="image_description"><img class="size-full wp-image-1429" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.26.jpg" alt="Sleeper bus" width="3120" height="4160"> <em>Sleeper buses are comfortable and cheap, but very cold! Always bring long sleeves with you since you're going to get frozen!</em></div>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In western countries, we never experienced a drive or saw a sleeper bus like in Vietnam. Of course, some people refer a sleeper bus to a bus that travels during the night, but by Vietnamese standards, that’s just another bus.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A sleeper bus is an amazing way of transportation around the country because it’s cheap and usually has a certain level of comfort. It’s really crazy how the people invented sleeper buses.</span>
<blockquote>
<h3><em>It's not the most comfortable driving experience, but it's cheap and it can save you money on accommodation. Take warm clothes since the AC is always on crazy low levels!</em></h3>
</blockquote>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Basically, they order normal buses, remove all the seats from inside and customize them to make sleeping and adjustable chairs. It’s kinda comfortable for the short people, but if you’re taller and you don’t like AC, then maybe it won’t be the most pleasurable experience. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The tickets are very affordable and you can basically <strong>travel half of the country for 500k VND</strong>. Also, always book a trip during the night as you can save money on accommodation since it’s possible to catch some sleep in the sleeper bus. </span>
<h2><b>#27 Busy Students </b></h2>
<div class="image_description"><img class="size-full wp-image-1447" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.IMG_20180501_171409.jpg" alt="Playing football with countryside kids" width="2592" height="1944"> <em>Students are very busy with school obligations and they barely have some free time. When they have a free time, they usually enjoy playing football or just being active and social.</em></div>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Student lifestyle is dynamic and very busy because of their tough schedule. From the primary school, the students need to pass through schooling formalities like wearing the uncomfortable uniforms, having the classes in the morning and afternoon, so much homework during the weekend and of course, school during the summer. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s very tough for younger students to cope with all of that since they don’t have much free time to enroll in activities they really like. Education in Vietnam is <strong>very formal and outdated</strong>, so the majority of stuff people are learning in the school will never give them the advantage in real life. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">College students are living in a totally different world. Usually, kids from the countryside come to big cities to continue their studies and improve their chances to get a better life. We’ve met a crazy amount of college students who are studying for a long time during the weekend and then working two or more part-time jobs at the same time to support their schooling or lifestyles.</span>

<strong>Learn the facts:</strong>&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://factsanddetails.com/southeast-asia/Vietnam/sub5_9f/entry-3457.html">Everything about education in Vietnam!</a></strong>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Imagine how tough it can be! On top of that, many students and young people saw the importance of knowing English, so they enroll in extra classes to improve their English levels. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>Very hard working people from the young ages!</em> </span>
<h2><b>#28 Bargaining is the MUST!</b></h2>
<div class="image_description"><img class="size-full wp-image-1430" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.28.jpg" alt="Local food market" width="4160" height="2340"> <em>Whenever you are buying anything on the street or you can't see the prices, always ask for the price in front and be ready to bargain! It's the part of the culture!</em></div>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Bargaining culture in Vietnam is real! Everyone bargains and everyone will try to make a bit of money on you if you’re not familiar with usual prices and bargaining tactics. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We almost never bargained before coming to Vietnam, but as soon as you arrive, you will realize that some people are <em>paying even triple price less than you</em>. Then you start to think about why and what you can do to pay a similar price.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Bargaining isn’t that hard since everyone wants to sell their goods. If there is no menu or pricing list, it means the bargaining is the must or you will overpay.</span>
<blockquote>
<h3><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some people don’t bargain and they complain they’ve got ripped off. Usually, you will pay a bit higher price than locals, even after bargaining, but it’s bearable!</span></em></h3>
</blockquote>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">After living for 9 months in Vietnam, Antonio has got the experience that people will usually tell you 3 times bigger price at the beginning, but will most likely settle for <strong>30% - 50% of the beginning price.</strong> </span>

<em><span style="font-weight: 400;">What you can do to make your bargaining skills shine?</span></em>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Never show people that you really want something so much as they will instantly notice that. Be relaxed and offer 30% of the beginning price and accept 50%. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s great to know the usual prices for locals since on some things you can’t offer a 30% price as people will get offended!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Do your research before going to buy things and you will be more than fine. Also, bargaining is a lot of fun and people in Vietnam love it!</span>
<h2><b>#29 Rapid Development of the Tourist Destinations</b></h2>
<div class="image_description"><img class="size-full wp-image-1431" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.29.jpg" alt="Da Nang beach" width="4608" height="3456"> <em>Some cities are undergoing rapid development since tourism became a huge industry. People in Da Nang said that they can't recognize the city when they compare it with the city 10 years ago.</em></div>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Vietnam is slowly becoming the most attractive tourist destination in the SEA region. It’s not a surprise as the country has stunning landscape on each step, delicious and diverse cuisine, friendly people with beautiful smiles and you can travel on a tight budget without missing anything! What more to ask for?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the last 10 years, the country has undergone rapid changes when it comes to development in tourist infrastructure. A huge portion of the money is coming from international tourists and it’s so evident as you can see new hotels and resorts are building up every day. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We saw the building of a hotel when we first reached Da Nang and when Antonio moved to Da Nang a few months later, the hotel was operating. Imagine that!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Locals, especially in Da Nang, said they can’t believe how many <strong><a href="https://saigoneer.com/saigon-development/6726-photos-da-nang-coastal-city-%E2%80%93-change-over-time">changes the city underwent in the last 10 years</a></strong>. The several bridges were built, the beachfront area is completely different and modern and many job opportunities are opening each day. Young people are extremely happy since it gives them many opportunities when it comes to jobs.</span>
<h2><strong>#30 Delicious and Strong Coffee With Condensed Milk</strong></h2>
<div class="image_description"><img class="size-full wp-image-1432" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.30.jpg" alt="Milk coffee" width="4608" height="3456"> <em>Coffee with condensed milk is a real pleasure to drink. It is very tasty, sweet and it will give you a proper boost for your day!</em></div>
If you can't start your day without a cup of a strong coffee, then Vietnam will be a pleasant experience for you. The country is the huge exporter of coffee and the beans hugely differ from province to province.

We had a chance to try many different <a href="https://vietnamchronicles.com/vietnamese-coffee-culture">coffee types in Vietnam</a>, but by far, our favorite is a simple milk coffee -&nbsp;cà phê&nbsp;<em>sữa.</em>

<strong>Did you know:</strong>&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://www.worldstopexports.com/coffee-exports-country/">Vietnam is the second largest coffee exporter in the world!</a></strong>

Their milk coffee is totally different from other milk coffees we had a chance to try around the world since they mix it with a sweet condensed milk. This combination gives your coffee a creamy texture with a sweet taste which is so addictive. It's so easy to start drinking a few coffees per day in Vietnam.

If you're drinking coffee outside, expect to pay <strong>around 10k - 20k VND on the street and up to 50k VND in a nice coffee shop</strong>. We tried both and we must say that coffee on the street simply rocks since it is strong and nothing gives you a better boost than sitting on the street, observing local life while enjoying the sips from your cup!

Antonio had a chance to experience many different beans and ways to make a coffee, so he came up with a <strong><a href="http://vietnamchronicles.com/vietnamese-drip-coffee-guide">guide on making Vietnamese drip coffee</a></strong>. You need a coffee phin filter and basically, you can make your milk coffee anywhere!
<h2><b>#31 Hard Language</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Vietnamese language is a <strong>tonal language with 6 different tones</strong>. The words change the meaning depending on the tone. For instance, there are many words that are spelled the same, but just one tone makes the whole meaning different. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a real struggle for foreigners to get cope with the language as people are speaking so fast and sometimes it’s hard to understand. When you start to travel around the country you will notice how the dialect changes depending on the place you’re in. The northern dialect is much different than central or southern. It makes mastering the language even harder for foreigners. </span>
<blockquote>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>The good thing is that Vietnamese people write in the Latin alphabet, which makes the life much easier when traveling and trying to navigate or even checking the food on the menu.</em> </span></h3>

<h2><b>#32 Ah These Vietnamese Women - Beautiful Human Beings</b></h2>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’ve ever had a chance to date a Vietnamese woman, then you will totally understand every word. Vietnamese women are simply rocking with their beauty and kindness! </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the countryside, the women are a bit conservative since the life in the small environment is going along with much stigma, but the women are the nicest human beings ever! Also, stunningly beautiful with genuine smiles that can change your day completely! The only problem in the countryside is the language barrier, since not so many people are able to talk English. It can be manageable, but after some time you will definitely lose interest as you can’t connect on a deeper level with a person without understanding each other language.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Antonio was dating a woman in the countryside for a while and the biggest problem for them was a language barrier. He found out a way around it by talking through Google Translate, but soon, they ended up. He explained it as the weirdest dating experience in his life as they didn’t speak anything just sharing the phone with translations.</span>
<blockquote>
<h3><em>The language barrier and culture differences combined with the power of globalization make dating very dynamic in Vietnam. Vietnamese women are one of the most beautiful women we had the chance to meet!</em></h3>
</blockquote>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the cities is much different and women are <strong>more open-minded and liberal about dating</strong>. Also, the language barrier is still existent, but not on that huge level as in the countryside. For instance, many women want to get married or get babies or will tell you they love you after few dates. Also, it not uncommon they become over caring which can be totally opposite of attraction. </span>

<em><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>We’re totally sure you will fall in love with beautiful Vietnamese women! Just don’t get married too soon!</strong> </span></em>
<h2><b>#33 Bottoms Up with Beer</b></h2>
<div class="image_description"><img class=" wp-image-1453" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.IMG_20180319_112636.jpg" alt="Beer Hanoi" width="799" height="1066"> <em>Cheers!</em></div>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Vietnamese people are very keen on food, hanging out with family and friends and of course, drinking their alcohol. In the north and during the winter time, people usually drink their iconic rice wine. During the hot months, you will see thousands of small chairs around with the beer and the ice. </span>
<blockquote>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>People are literally destroying the beers, but not on your usual way - they are doing bottoms up with a beer.</em> </span></h3>
</blockquote>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Usually, they put the ice in the glass and fill the glass with the beer and then yell <em>“Cham Fan Cham”</em> which literally means 100%. When someone tells that, you can’t reject as it can be very rude or even offensive to some locals. It’s better to just follow what they are doing as you’ll have a lot of fun. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, the tradition here is when people invite you to drink with them, <strong>you should invite them too</strong>. Don’t forget to shake hands after finishing your shot of beer.</span>

<strong>Learn more:&nbsp;<a href="http://vietcetera.com/alcohol-consumption-in-vietnam-truths-and-trends/">Vietnam drinking traditions and scene</a></strong>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Bottoms up with a beer sounds very tough for a stomach, and believe me it is, but people make it easier as they usually enjoy delicious food that goes perfectly with a beer. </span>
<h2><b>#34 Friendliness of People</b></h2>
<div class="image_description"><img class="size-full wp-image-1433" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.34.jpg" alt="Friendly Vietnamese people" width="4160" height="2340"> <em>Vietnamese people, heads down, are by far the friendliest and most hospitable people we had a chance to meet.</em></div>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The best part when it comes to Vietnamese people is their friendliness, kindness, and willingness to help. They are simply rocking on these things!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When we were traveling around the country, we were always changing the locations and meeting new local people. Every time we were surprised by the <strong>friendliness of these people without expecting anything in the return</strong>. </span>

<em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many times, Antonio ended up without gas in the middle of nowhere and the locals always give a hand without understanding the language. Also, Antonio crashed the bike in Da Nang with another woman and locals were just smiling at the beginning but soon, they jumped and helped with the bike and the wounds. They even bought the medicine for him and try their best to make him feel good and healthy. </span></em>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We felt so welcomed in Vietnam and in many places, it felt more like home than in Croatia. Also, people are very keen on football, so we were very lucky to travel around the world cup as Vietnamese were mainly cheering for Croatia. </span>
<blockquote>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>It was a nice feeling when you pass around the countryside and you see a Vietnamese person wearing Croatian football dress!</em> </span></h3>
</blockquote>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Such amazing people! </span>
<h2><b>#35 Value of Speaking English</b></h2>
<div class="image_description"><img class="size-full wp-image-1449" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.36331417_883723108494095_3435324016838049792_o.jpg" alt="In the English classroom" width="1944" height="1296"> <em>The English language is on a high demand and everyone wants to learn with foreigners.</em></div>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the most important things when it comes to education and opportunities in Vietnam is by far English language. Literally, everyone wants to learn English in the country and it is a good thing since the country opened their borders to international businesses in the 90s and there are many international companies and crazy tourism industry. The English language opens many doors to local people to have a better quality lifestyle.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>Kids from the young ages are enrolled in the private schools where English teachers who’re usually foreigners are teaching for crazy sums of money.</em> </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, locals who are good at English have so much more opportunities and also, their salary hugely depends on your English knowledge. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the situation isn’t the best when it comes to English as there is still a huge language barrier. The situation in the cities is quite good, but in the countryside, sometimes you won’t be able to stumble on a single person who knows more than <em>“Hello”</em>. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Antonio was living in the part of the country where some people probably never saw a foreigner person. English levels there are so poor that you need to learn a bit of Vietnamese to be able to cope with the most basic daily situations. </span>
<h2><b>#36 Importance of Skin Color</b></h2>

It's very evident in Vietnam.</em></div>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s crazy to say it, but it’s very evident that people here give too much importance to a skin color. The huge stigma is connected to the skin color and brown people are perceived as the farmers or people of lower status. Many people pay too much attention to skin color to the levels where their skin looks completely unnaturally white!</span>

<strong>Interesting read:</strong>&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://matadornetwork.com/bnt/white-skin-why-racism-in-asia-isnt-quite-what-you-think/">Importance of skin color in Asia</a></strong>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re thinking of becoming an English teacher in Vietnam, then you will experience huge racism in that field. Employers and parents don’t care so much about teacher’s qualifications as their skin color and appearance. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve met a person who is literally overqualified to become a teacher, but with a huge teaching passion, he wanted to become a teacher in Vietnam. The problem was that he is an Indian with a brown skin color and he had a tough time to find a job so at the end he gave up! </span>
<h2><b>#37 Passionate Football Fans</b></h2>

Antonio went to few celebrations and it is simply amazing since all the people are doing things together and the whole nation is ONE!</em></div>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve been traveling around the country during the World Cup and it was a crazy good atmosphere around the country with many people watching the matches and wearing dresses of countries around the world. As the World Cup was going to the end, many people started to cheer for Croatia so it wasn’t weird to see people wearing Croatian dresses even in the countryside. It was such a crazy experience to see people know about your country!</span>
<blockquote>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>Vietnamese people are passionate about their food, drinks and of course, football!</em> </span></h3>
</blockquote>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to football in Vietnam, people also get very crazy. In recent years, Vietnamese football went through great changes and the teams are playing a very good football. Currently, they are playing the finals of AFF cup and the whole country is supporting the team. Everytime Vietnam is playing, everyone stops to do their things and start to watch football.</span>

<strong>Update:&nbsp;</strong>Vietnam won the finals for the first time in the last 10 years! The celebration was simply AMAZING!

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When you drive around the city, you will even see <strong>people staying in front of technology shops and watching football while drinking and cheering!</strong> </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">After the match, it’s the time for “di bao” where people put the red colors on themselves and go on the streets. Literally, the streets change the atmosphere in seconds and everything becomes a good hell!</span>

<em><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong> People usually drink a lot, drive motorbikes, cheer and scream. It’s an amazing feeling to be in the middle of that!</strong> </span></em>
<h2><b>#38 Propaganda in the Countryside</b></h2>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Around <strong>70% of the Vietnamese population still lives in the countryside</strong> where the access and quality of education is noticeably worse than in cities. Majority of the population in the countryside are older people while younger people move to cities to study and find the opportunities that will make their lives much better.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Every morning and afternoon there are <em>‘news’</em> reproducing on loudspeakers around streets talking about different aspects of life in the countryside. We didn’t understand any things, but the only thing we know is that it’s crazy loud and it’s literally impossible not to hear it.</span>

<strong>Further read:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/in-vietnam-propaganda-lives-on-7890376">Propaganda is still a huge thing in the country</a></strong>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We were very shocked by how they want people to listen to their <em>‘news’</em> so we started to talk with locals about this news and what are the topics. Basically, they are selecting and filtering things they want people to hear and follow.</span>
<h2><b>#39 Incredibly Active and Healthy People</b></h2>
<div class="image_description"><img class="size-full wp-image-1437" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.39.jpg" alt="Active people on the beach" width="4608" height="3456"> <em>People around the country are extremely active! It's not uncommon to see them working out on the beach or streets after dinner or before a breakfast.</em></div>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">People in Vietnam are extremely healthy and active, that especially applies to people in the countryside. For instance, in the countryside, people usually tend to <strong>wake up around the sunrise and they do the power walking with the neighbors</strong>. It’s a perfect way for them to socialize and energize their bodies for the hard work that is coming!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve seen so many people in the cities doing bodyweight training that have incredible levels of strength and stamina at old ages. It was really impressive to see that level of determination.</span>

<strong>Did you know:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.weareaugustines.com/blog/is-vietnamese-food-the-healthiest-in-the-world/">Vietnamese cuisine is one of the healthiest in the world</a></strong>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, Vietnamese food is one of the healthiest cuisines in the world, with almost no junk and processed food so it’s easier to get and keep your body healthy.</span>
<h2><b>#40 Way of Communicating With Foreigners </b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This one might not apply to everyone since it’s completely from Antonio’s experience working with schools around Vietnam. After talking with other teachers and sharing the stories, we can say that many teachers share the same experience. Also, when we thought about the way people communicate with foreigners, we can notice it in a normal life too. </span>

<em><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>It’s a bit hard to understand or notice it if you’re not living in Vietnam for a bit, but pay attention and you might experience this one.</strong> </span></em>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Vietnamese people, according to our experience, are one of the best people we’ve had a chance to interact with. We generally like how they treat foreigners and how they communicate with them, but when you stay there for a long, you will see a bit different layer.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, people are scared to tell you the whole truth as they think you’ll get offended and they don’t want to offend a foreigner. They will tell you a partial truth and you will have a hard time putting the pieces together. In every school Antonio was working, he experienced that.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Is it just a language barrier or purposely selecting the information you will hear, it’s up to you to judge.</strong> </span>
<h2><b>#41 Dirty Cheap Fresh Beer</b></h2>
<div class="image_description"><img class="size-full wp-image-1456" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.bia_.jpg" alt="Vietnamese fresh beer" width="1024" height="744"> <em>Probably the cheapest beer in the world. Expect to pay around 20k VND for 2l of fresh beer. Drink fast as it evaporates quickly!</em></div>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re a beer lover and really passionate about tasting different beer, then Vietnam might disappoint you since their beer isn’t the best, but! </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah, there is always a but! Their beer is very cheap and the beer culture is very vibrant and active. Vietnam is the home of probably the world’s cheapest beer called fresh beer or Bia hơi.</span>

<strong>Funny fact:&nbsp;<a href="https://trip101.com/article/drink-the-cheapest-beer-in-the-world-in-hanoi">Vietnamese fresh beer is one of the cheapest beers in the world!</a></strong>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The history of making fresh beer is very interesting since that kind of beer was born during the war. People loved the rice wine, but as the shortage of food was a real problem during the war, the rice was banned to be used to make the alcohol. Vietnamese people simply love their alcohol, so they invented fresh beer. They made a beer from many different ingredients and put it in a huge pot. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, the fresh beer culture is huge, especially in Hanoi where you can see many people drinking beer from the glasses. Beer is stored in huge pots and it’s important to drink it fast since it evaporates even faster. </span>
<blockquote>
<h3><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price for one glass of 0.25l is around 5,000VND. We stumbled upon a 2l bottle of fresh beer for 20k VND.&nbsp;</span></em></h3>
</blockquote>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The taste differs hugely from place to place and some beers are very strong. For instance, three of us were <strong>drinking 2l of fresh beer and we got a decent buzz!</strong></span>
<h2><b>#42 Iconic Red Chairs</b></h2>
<div class="image_description"><img class="size-full wp-image-1438" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.42.jpg" alt="Drinking coffee on the street" width="4160" height="2340"> <em>Every street restaurant or small shop has iconic red chairs that are sometimes very uncomfortable, but that's the way in Vietnam.</em></div>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Ah, these tiny and funny red chairs. We’re from Croatia and we’re using tiny red chairs when kids are playing. It always reminds us of amazing childhood. In Vietnam, we were blown away when we saw these tiny red chairs all over. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We landed in Hanoi and the city is literally full with the <strong>small chairs and tables where people eat or enjoy their night drinks</strong> with friends or family. Once you’re in Vietnam, there is no a chance that you’re going to miss these chairs. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">At first, we had the struggle to sit on these since we are all taller than 185 cm, so it’s kind of uncomfortable, but after some time, it became a second nature. </span>

<em><strong>Whenever you want to eat their iconic street food or amazingly cheap fresh beer, be prepared for the red chairs! &nbsp;</strong></em>
<h2><b>#43 Boxes of Beers Everywhere</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">As you may already know, Vietnamese people are passionate drinkers and they like to invite foreigners to their table to drink with them. If you think you can drink more than Vietnamese people, be careful! They take drinking very seriously and <strong>they will outdrink you as they are doing it every night! </strong></span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a very amazing thing when you come to the restaurant or just sit down on small chairs somewhere on the street for a beer, you won’t get just one beer; you will get a whole box of beer! Just in case you get thirsty!</span>
<blockquote>
<h3><em>Ordering one beer in the local restaurant always ends up with the box of beers on your table!</em></h3>
</blockquote>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Imagine this scene. You get to the restaurant and order a few beers, but the waiter comes and gives you 24 beers (1 carton box) with the bucket of ice. After you’re done with a drinking session, the waiter will come with the paper and check how much beers you drank and charge accordingly.</span>

<em><strong>Are they lazy to always bring the new beers or are they just smart sellers? We’re going to leave it to you to answer!</strong></em>
<h2><b>#44 Tattoos are Still Taboo Topic</b></h2>
<div class="image_description"><img class="size-full wp-image-1457" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.tattoo.jpg" alt="Tattoos in Vietnam" width="1280" height="853"> <em>Tattoos in Vietnam are still a taboo topic, but the country is slowly opening to the trend and accepting tattoos.</em></div>
<em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ah, these tattoos...</span></em>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s still a taboo topic around the country, but the urban population is developing on a very rapid rate, so the taboo is slowly fading away. In the cities, there are many tattoo shops popping out and you can see many young people wearing crazy beautiful art on their bodies. Many people wear full-sleeve tattoos or huge pieces of art. Also, women started to express their personalities through tattoos, but the majority of them have a few smaller symbolic tattoos which can be very attractive.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the countryside, tattoos are a huge taboo and people wearing tattoos are seen as bad people related to gangs.</span>

<strong>Experiences of local people:&nbsp;<a href="https://vietnam.vnanet.vn/english/tattoo-from-taboo-to-popular-art-form/376509.html">How is it to live with tattoos in Vietnam?</a></strong>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Antonio was living in the countryside where he had a chance to talk with many people about their opinion on tattoos. Majority of them said it’s fine to see a foreigner with tattoos, but for a local person having tattoos, it represents a trouble.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>He also had an opportunity to meet many people wearing tattoos in the countryside and the only he can say is that these people don’t differ from the other locals.</em> Very hospitable, funny, friendly people who’re always for drinking or doing funny things. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Our opinion is that tattoos are a huge taboo in Vietnam, but as the country is getting the influence from western culture, people get more open-minded.</span>
<h2><b>#45 Cosmetic Products </b></h2>
<div class="image_description"><img class="size-full wp-image-1458" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.cosmetics.jpg" alt="Skin care" width="1280" height="853"> <em>It's really crazy how much effort Vietnamese people put in keeping their skin clean, healthy and white.</em></div>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The skin care market is huge and booming at a <strong><a href="https://www.statista.com/outlook/70020000/127/skin-care/vietnam">whopping 3.2% annually</a>!</strong> It’s really crazy how many people take care of their skin seriously. It’s not only because of the health but also because of trends and stigma connected to skin color.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Basically, every skin care product has chemicals that give you a whitening effect. It’s so hard to find a normal skin care product without whitening effect and also, these products are more expensive.</span>
<blockquote>
<h3><em>A hard mission in Vietnam is to find a skin product without a whitening effect! Even if you manage to find it, expect to pay the higher price!</em></h3>
</blockquote>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">People value white skin and they see it as more valuable than any other skin color since it’s connected to a higher status in their eyes. Like we already mentioned, the brown color is connected to working class and many people don’t want to be perceived as farmers, even if they are. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">White skin is a huge trend from China, Japan and Korea, and Vietnam is hugely influenced by these cultures, so younger people, for instance, just follow the huge trend.</span>

<em><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>In Europe is totally different, everyone wants to be brown, so it’s probably that you want what you don’t have.</strong> </span></em>
<h2><b>#46 Huge Korean Cultural Influence</b></h2>
<div class="image_description"><img class="size-full wp-image-1459" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.korean.jpg" alt="Korean influence in Vietnam" width="1280" height="809"> <em>There is a huge Korean influence in Vietnam!</em></div>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Korean influence is very visible in Vietnamese culture and demographic structure. Korea has a huge influence on a whole of Asia, but their drama called <em>“Hallyu”</em> is responsible for the cultural influence. Vietnamese television started to reproduce these dramas around a decade ago and many young people started to follow the trends from these shows.</span>

<strong>Learn more:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.eastasiaforum.org/2015/02/19/vietnam-catches-the-korean-wave/">Korean influence in Vietnam</a></strong>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">These shows are showing how Korean people interact with people, the way they deal with daily challenges, love life, fashion aspects and much more. Also, K-pop which is Korean music reached the fame in Vietnam a few years back. Almost every teenager knows about K-pop and a few artists. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Korean cultural influence is one of the reasons why Vietnamese people value skin color so much since the social status is largely connected with skin color.</span>
<h2><b>#47 Getting in Problems While Talking About Government</b></h2>
<div class="image_description"><img class="size-full wp-image-1439" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.47.jpg" alt="Vietnam flag" width="4608" height="3456"> <em>Be careful what you're talking about the government since these are very sensitive topics.</em></div>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want to get arrested in Vietnam, probably the easiest way is to go to protests against the government and take pictures or videos. These are very sensitive topics for the government and <em>‘well-being’</em> of its people, so it’s always monitored by the government officials. If they see a foreigner around, you will become their focus instantly since the last thing they want is to spread the local topics outside the country.</span>

<strong>Read a story:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/20/world/asia/vietnam-will-nguyen.html">American arrested at a protest</a></strong>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Any topic about the government is very sensitive. If you’re talking or sharing these stories, be sure that you’re not doing that on the mainstream platform. In the best case, you might be deported, or even imprisoned.</span>
<h2><b>#48 Overstaff at Working Places</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you think your working place isn’t efficient, then wait to come to Vietnam. Every working space has at least 3 people doing a job that can be done by one person. The result?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You will see many people sleeping, not paying attention or entertaining themselves on the phones while earning money. We don’t have any problem with that and we think that it’s a good thing since the young people earn money, but from the productive side, it’s so funny to observe it as an outsider.</span>
<h2><strong>#49 Six People on the Bike or Even Moving a House Isn't Rare to See</strong></h2>
<div class="image_description"><img class="size-full wp-image-1440" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.49.jpg" alt="Five people on the motorbike" width="4160" height="2340"> <em>The scene like this is totally normal in Vietnam.</em></div>
One of the first culture shocks we experienced, along with a crazy traffic, were overloaded motorbikes everywhere. We saw a crazy amount of things people are transporting on their tiny motorbikes. In Vietnam, you can see many things, animals and who knows what people transporting on a daily basis.
<blockquote>
<h3><em>It's not strange to see people transporting few times bigger things on their motorbike than their bikes. Also, we saw people transporting another motorbike on the bike; that one was very funny!</em></h3>
</blockquote>
The most often thing you will see is driving more than two people on the bike. During our trip, it was a daily scene. Sometimes it shocks you as you can see a few kids on the bike without any protection. It's quite dangerous and in Croatia for example, you will probably lose your kids if someone reports you. Not in Vietnam!

After driving for more than 10,000 km around the country, Antonio tried the same, so there is his cosplay of doing it!
<div class="image_description"><img class="size-full wp-image-1441" src="http://localhost/vietnamchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_image.491.jpg" alt="Vietnam cosplay" width="1280" height="720"></div>

<hr>

That would be it! 49 culture shocks you will experience in Vietnam!

The list is huge, but expect us to update it once we experience the next culture shock.

Sorry for writing a huge article, but we believe it's a great preparation for people who're traveling to Vietnam, especially the first-timers.
